## Third foundation of mindfulness citta nupassana


The third foundation of mindfulness is contemplation of the mind or 
mind states. Meditation is mind development. As our practice develops we 
give  more  and  more  emphasis  to  the  mind,  to  watching  the  mind.  In  particular, in watching defiled mind states. We are training the mind. Training 
to do what? To observe, weaken and destroy these defilements which enter 
our  sense  experience  and  cause  dukkha.  The  Buddha’s  teaching  is  full  of 
groupings  of  these  defilements  or  imperfections.  In  particular  the  satipat-
thana tells us to look at greed, hatred and delusion.
*Lobha*
,
*dosa*
and
*moha*
.
The
*ten fetters*
is another group. Or the seven latent tendencies,
*anusaia*
. The
three taints, the
*asavas*
. The five hindrances,
*nivanas*
. All of these different 
groupings  of  defiled  mind  states,  imperfections  or  corruptions  come  from 
three roots. Lobha, dosa and moha; greed, hatred and delusion. These three
roots have their base in ignorance, in unknowing, in unawareness,
*avija*
. If 
we are unaware of the present moment experience, than that experience is an 
experience with ignorance. Ignorance arises and starts to condition the mind 
and body process in that moment. In fact, in that moment the whole experience stands on ignorance. That is an unaware moment. It is a moment which 
is going to be dukkha. When there is ignorance and craving, there is dukkha.
When ignorance and craving ceases, dukkha ceases.
*[161]{.pdfpage}  And this doesn’t happen*
*anywhere or for any time except for right here and right now.*
These things 
are occurring right now, this is a present moment experience. It is either one 
with awareness, knowledge, or with unawareness, ignorance.

The aim this afternoon is not to give you a catalogue of the impurities 
of  the  mind. We  are  just  going  to  have  a  look  at  a  few  ones,  in  particular 
those  which  pull  us  out  into  wanting  states  and  those  modes  that  push  us 
away: attracting and aversion. Our mindfulness practice endeavors to experience  them,  to  get  to  know  them,  so  that  they  can  be  let  go  of.  Without 
knowing and seeing them, it is not possible to let them go. In the first of the
four noble truths ‘there is dukkha’, the Buddha said,
*«dukkha must be under-*
*stood»*
. It must be understood. We must realize it through our own wisdom. 
For us to do this we must have right attitude. We need to make sure that we 
are meditating with the right intentions. Right attitude allows us to observe 
and accept whatever is happening, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, in a 
relaxed and alert manner, not over focussing – we are not causing stress or 
tension in the mind – we are open and comfortable, we are spacious in the 
mind,  we  are  just  spaciously  observing,  we  are  just  watching. We  are  not 
interfering with things. Most of all we are accepting, we have to accept that 
good  and  bad  experiences  occur.  Every  experience  whether  good  or  bad, 
gives us an experience to learn something about the nature of that particular 
conditioned phenomena. If it is a good experience, we probably attach to it 
and want to keep it. If it is a bad experience we probably do not want it and 
try to push it away. In both cases we are attaching, we are identifying with 
that particular phenomena taking it as mine, happening to me or taking that 
experience  happening  for  me.  When  we  do  this  with  all  our  experiences 
continuously again and again, subjectifying, taking them as mine or me than 
we build a sense of I. All these little moments of me and mine crystallize 
and become more concrete in a stronger sense of subjectivity, a more intense 
form of the self, an I. An I becomes to be born. If all these things are happening to me and all this stuff is mine, than it is very natural for the idea of 
«I am». It occurs. If this is all me and mine, well then «I am», I have a self. 
And so the mind and body process start to believe it is someone. It has come 
under the full sway of ignorance.


## [162]{.pdfpage}  Craving


Craving  is  manifesting  in  every  moment,  craving  for  being,
*bhava*
*tanha*
,  entering  into  the  sense  experience,  flooding  our  experience  from 
moment  after  moment  with  infection  of  the  self,  infection  of  the  ego. We 
need  to  notice  whether  our  mind  accepts  things  how  they  are,  or  whether 
there is liking or disliking, whether there is some judging or reactions. We 
need  to  watch  ourselves  with  our  motivations  for  our  meditation  practice. 
We need to keep checking to see with what kind of mind state we are practicing. If we are practicing with wishing, wanting – «I have to get in this meditation this far, I have got to get…» – then you are blocking your meditation 
from developing. That wanting is a little bit of desire and is stopping us from 
entering into the present moment.

Whatever  happens  in  the  body  is  dhamma,  whatever  happens  in  the 
mind is dhamma. It is all dhamma-nature. Nothing is happening to you or 
for you. We are appropriating it. It is taking ownership itself. That is only 
because it does not know and not see. It just decides to take ownership of 
things. It seeks an identity and finds one in our daily lives in our daily sense 
experiences. Feeling hot is just feeling hot, it is just dhamma-nature. We will 
feel much hotter if we start to identify with that heat. In fact we can give ourselves dukkha. When the body starts to feel hot, like it is today, we can make 
a note ‘warmth, heat, sweating’, whatever it is, whatever the physical sensation is at this moment, make a note of it, know it, stop identifying with it, so 
that the heat is let go – it is your attachment we are talking of here, we are 
not turning the weather off – the body still remains hot but we have stopped 
attaching to it so you don’t find it that unpleasant. It is still hotness, there is 
still some heat but you have turned off your attachment so that we turned 
off the dukkha. It is only if we hold things that dukkha comes to destroy us.
*Allow it to be as it is! Accept things as they are! Let them roll-out.*
They are 
impermanent and will pass away very rapidly anyhow. Why ruin your morning, why ruining your afternoon by a little bit of attachment to something, 
cause some dukkha for yourself. Don’t write any dukkha in your schedule. 
We  don’t  need  it.  –  Everything  that  is  happening  is  happening  because  of 
cause and effect. Our work is to have the right attitude to maintain awareness, to use our intelligence, to have interest in the practice.


## [163]{.pdfpage}  Ignorance


Ignorance of these defiled states of mind affects our attitude. When we 
don’t understand the nature of these corruptions in the mind, when we have 
wrong attitude, we can’t help being affected by them. They do affect our life. 
It  is  important  that  we  recognize  and  investigate  our  wrong  attitudes  and 
straighten them up. At this time of the retreat, if you are trying to meditate 
to get some results, please stop that. Drop any expectational desire for any 
results. Just do your work of putting the conditions in place. The results will 
take care of themselves. Try to understand how these wrong attitudes really 
affect our practice when we have some strong expectations. When we have 
expectations  and  these  expectations  are  not  fulfilled  –  what  is  that  state? 
Dukkha!  So  drop  your  expectations  and  guess  what  disappears  –  dukkha 
disappears.  So  don’t  try  to  create  or  expect  anything.  Trying  to  create  or 
expect anything to happen is greed, lobha. Don’t reject what is happening. 
Rejecting what is happening is aversion, dosa. Not activating our awareness 
in the present is not-knowing, it is ignorance, unawareness, moha, delusion. 
So we don’t try to make things the way that we want them to be. We don’t 
try  to  make  things  happen,  the  way  we  want  them  to  happen. We  are  just 
trying to know what is happening as it is happening. Wanting this to happen 
or not to happen is expectations. Expectation leads to anxiety and that can 
lead to aversion.

It is important that we are aware of our expectations, our wanting to 
become a meditator, get meditation to be put in our CV, another thing we 
can do, just another activity that we can use to create an identity, for others 
to look at. We are not in the identity or personality creating game here. That 
is not what the retreat or meditation is about. It is about freeing ourselves 
exactly from that thing. Getting all excited about becoming a meditator, a 
retreatant. Have a look at that if you start going into that mind-set. Don’t use 
your practice as another foundation for the creating of a self. The practice 
is meant for removing the sense of self. It is not for building up a spiritual 
credential. We are learning to let go of that mental attitude of trying to create 
and generate a personality.

Our societies generally promote developing a very strong sense of self. 
We come from competitive societies. We have created social and economic 
 [164]{.pdfpage}  systems based on competition. We are competitive. Instead of cooperating 
with each other we are competing with each other, fighting and scrambling 
who can be the strongest, the fastest, the richest, the funniest, the smartest. 
We are competing. Our societies drive us to create an identity. The creator on 
our website, the owner on our business cards, to be able to tell people who 
we are or what we are. We don’t want to be nothing, do we? That is one of 
the nastiest things that anybody can say to us. «You are just nothing!» – If 
someone says that to me, «oh, thank you very much!» The practice is working!


## Aversion


Aversion  either  arises  from  the  things  that  are  not  the  way  we  think 
they should be, or, from a desire that they should be different. Or it arises 
simply from unawareness of what right practice is, not quite sure of what we 
meant to be doing in the Buddha’s teaching. We received a few instructions 
from here and there, but it is not quite clear yet exactly what we should be 
doing except for sitting on the floor and breathing. What else is it all about? 
We just get little bits and pieces here and there. We need to understand what 
the practice is all about. It is about letting go of our attachments! Our attachments that generate a sense of self, a me, mine and I, ego, egoic development, if you like.

Try to recognize dissatisfaction when it arises in the mind. Try to fully 
accept it, watch it, alertly, when the mind becomes dissatisfied or frustrated 
or irritated with something. Stop and observe, just feel and sense that experience. Don’t go into it. Don’t try to push it away. Just accept it while it is 
there. The dissatisfied mind is a wonderful learning tool, the mind of twisting and turning, not happy, complaining, wanting to escape, get out of here. 
Have a look at that mind state. It is wonderful to come in contact with it. 
Become to really see it what it is. When we see it clearly, dissatisfaction dissolves! Completely disappears. And we are left with comfort, with patience 
and with peace.

During the process of observation and exploration of dissatisfaction, 
its causes become clear. Our understanding dissolved the dissatisfaction. It 
may  return!  But  we  can  note  it,  know  it  and  let  it  go  again!  Dissatisfaction [165]{.pdfpage}   comes  from  unfulfilled  expectations,  unfulfilled  desires,  craving.  We 
see more and more clearly the harm that dissatisfaction causes the mind and 
body, we can watch it, we can see the trouble that it makes. But when we 
step back of it, we can see how easy it is to step out of this dissatisfied mind 
and stop identifying with it. Stop getting caught up in the story that is being 
generated. When we get caught up to it and attach to our own thinking, our 
own  whinging  and  complaining,  when  we  use  whinging  and  complaining 
for a base of self, as a foundation for the arising of self, then it shouldn't be 
a surprise to you that you aren’t so happy. We just generated a self-moment 
based on whinging and complaining. Of course it is going to be a dissatisfying moment. It is dukkha.


## Wrong attitude


Wrong attitudes are caused by delusion. Not truly knowing what the 
practice is and how to practice. We all have these delusions and wrong attitudes.  Defilements  of  craving  and  aversion  and  all  the  relatives  they  may 
have. Not accepting defilements only strengthens them. We have to accept 
that they exist and arise. Old karma is manifesting, cause and effect set in 
operation. These  defilements  do  come  and  hinder  our  meditation  practice, 
they prevent us form living fully in the world. They shut us down. They turn 
our world into a duality.

So  we  need  to  understand  those  defiled  states  of  mind.  We  need  to 
watch  out  for  them  when  they  arise,  accept  them  that  they  are  there,  note 
them, know them and let them go. Don’t attach to them, don’t reject them, 
don’t  ignore  them.  Most  importantly,  don’t  identify  with  them. Try  to  see 
them  for  what  they  are:  impermanent,  dukkha  and  non-self. When  we  see 
our emotional states or defiled states of mind arising, we look at them this 
way so that we can let them go completely.

As  we  stop  attaching,  we’ll  stop  identifying  with  these  defiled  mind 
states,  their  strength  slowly  diminishes.  Things  that  used  to  stir  us  up,  to 
frustrate and irritate us, start to loose their power. We understand the irritated 
mind, we understand that it is dukkha. We know why it is happening so we 
can adjust our behavior accordingly. We can adjust our experience, we just 
need to activate our awareness more continuously in the present. Whenever 
 [166]{.pdfpage}  we  find  ourselves  attacked  by  an  emotional  state,  that  is  the  time  to  start 
noting,  that’s  the  time  to  start  stepping  back  and  stop  identifying  with  it 
before it becomes a habit, before we start developing a habit of identifying 
with  particular  mind  states. They  keep  coming  back,  again  and  again,  we 
keep looping on them and reacting on them. Craving for being is finding a 
lovely launching pad for it to gain a sense of self. Craving for being doesn’t 
mind if it is a pleasant or unpleasant experience. It just wants to be. Its only 
goal in the present moment experience is to infiltrate that experience, to get 
in there to infect the present with a sense of self. It’s a virus! The sense of 
self is a virus that comes to attack us. We have six vulnerable places: eye, 
ear, nose, tongue, body and mind door. We have to protect our doors from 
moment after moment to stop this virus entering. In the beginning stages of 
the practice it is difficult, there will be lots of gaps that it will keep leaking 
through. But if we note very rapidly, if we increase the speed at which we are 
noting the moment, then we can start to build up a barrier – like somebody to 
hold back the sea. You have to be very efficient to hold back the waves from 
coming  up  the  beach  because  those  waves  just  keep  coming.  Block  them 
with mindfulness and wisdom. Note every moment. Then those waves won’t 
be waves of dukkha but waves of equanimity, waves of bliss.

So Vipassana meditation is much more than simply observing things 
with a receptive mind. We also have to use wisdom, investigation of dhamma. 
We need to create space for wisdom to operate. Having mindfulness, bringing ourselves into the present and noting what’s there is not enough! If you 
are just going into the moment seeing what is there and noting it, noting it, 
noting it, if you are not using wisdom to detach and step back from it, then 
you are probably noting going into the story. You are noting and the story 
is  becoming  stronger.  In  our  satipatthana  text  it  says  very  clearly,  that  we
have  to  practice  with
*satisampajana*
,  with  mindfulness  and  clear  comprehension,  or  as  we  have  been  calling  it  this  week,  awareness  and  wisdom. 
Two different faculties. If we put energy in the mix, these three do the work 
of  noting,  knowing  and  letting  go  repeatedly  and  continuously.  We  can’t 
practice blindly or mechanically without thinking. Our meditation needs to 
be simple, not complicated. We have to come to understand the structure of 
our experience so that the letting go process can take place repeatedly.

[167]{.pdfpage}  When we are watching the mind, when we are turning our attention to 
the mind, it’s really talking about emotional states. If you become aware that 
an emotional state is there, just make a note such as ‘frustrated, frustrated’ 
and then come back to ‚rising, falling, sitting, touching, rising, falling, sitting, touching, rising, falling, sitting, touching, frustrated, frustrated’. Just 
take a note that it is there. Just observe, don’t interfere with it, don’t push it 
away. Don’t become upset that frustration is occurring. Don’t get annoyed 
with  the  frustration.  Don’t  find  it  unpleasant,  just  know  that  frustration  is 
occurring. This is not me, this is not mine, this is not my self. We have to 
understand that it is just a mental state that has arisen and that it will pass 
away very rapidly if it is not identified with. If it is identified with, then you 
have  to  take  it  on  board,  carry  it  with  your  bag  with  you.  It  is  a  piece  of 
dukkha. And you keep it until whatever causes the frustration passes away 
and then your frustration passes away and with it your dukkha. You don’t 
have to pick up every piece of dukkha that comes along your way. You do 
have a choice in the present moment, either awareness or dukkha! As simple 
as  that.  Which  do  you  want?  Up  until  now,  you  have  been  experiencing 
dukkha all your life. Now we have the opportunity to apply a slightly different strategy in our experience of the world. Instead of going into the story 
from our mind, we are stepping back from it. Letting go of it. We are creating 
space around the stories of our lives so that it passes away. Every moment is 
a new and fresh moment. Every moment is a new moment. Whatever dukkha 
has arisen before this particular moment, it has now passed, it’s history, it’s 
gone.  Don’t  bring  it  up  as  a  memory  again  and  start  dukkhering  yourself. 
It is gone! Why bring it into the present? Why bring your old stories in the 
form  of  memories  into  the  present  moment  and  attaching  and  identifying 
with them? It is because we do it, because these old stories give us a sense of 
self. «The poor me», «this is what happened to me». Think about it, we are 
generating thoughts about me! «How unfortunate I am» or «how sad it was 
that it happened to me, for me». Now these memories are just trigger points, 
new foundations, or should we say old foundations of self that have come 
back  to  revisit  again.  – The  future  is  the  same. The  planning  is  the  same. 
Why do we like to plan? Why do we like to prepare? Thinking about it over 
and over again. It gives us a sense of self. The planning for somebody. It is 
 [168]{.pdfpage}  my planning, it’s planning that I am going to do. These events, these states 
of mind are the foundations for self. Self is very tricky! Craving has been 
on the top of the tree for a very long time. It’s very tricky and very stable. 
To break it, to crack it, you need a jackhammer of awareness and wisdom. 
That is the only thing that can break it. Nothing else has been successful in 
breaking through ignorance.

Have  a  look  in  your  mind,  whether  you  are  having  some  blemishes, 
some emotional states, that you are attaching too. See whether you have any 
stains in your mind. If you do, like most of us, you got some work to do. Some 
spiritual work – that is what our life is about. The evolution of our mind, the 
development of our mind. If we see any faults, we need to be alerted to them, 
watch them and observe these faults. If you see a stain in your clothes, you 
wash it out. Luckily for us all the stains are the same. They just need a bit of 
soap powder to wash it out. Some are a little bit tougher than others, that is 
true. But the technique is the same: washing. It may take two or three times 
to wash the stains out. Some stains are stronger than others. Have a look at 
your clothes. See whether you have any of these mind states, that come to 
visit us, hang around, cause some trouble and leave again. Like a bunch of 
drunken  guys  coming  into  a  car  park  late  night  after  the  pub. They  cause 
some trouble and leave. If we get upset about that, it’s only because we are 
attaching. My place, my pleasantness, my sleeping time. We have attached 
to something and so somebody’s activity is annoying us. My town – what are 
these guys doing here? If we don’t mind what is going on, then it’s just what 
it is. When we mature in our view, hands off, ok, let it go. Those guys will 
go before morning and you have saved yourself a night of stress, worry and 
discomfort because you have been able to let go. If you haven’t let go then 
you had an awful night listening all night to these guys.

Have a look if there is any anger or resentment. These cause a lot of 
trouble. Maybe there is some ill will, hatred towards somebody. Maybe you 
look down on others just judging – maybe that’s your stain. Maybe there is 
some envy or avarice. We are jealous of what some people have got, what 
they have become or how their life has turned out. Maybe we really, really, 
really  want  something  –  avarice.  A  very  strong  form  of  wanting.  Maybe 
you are fraudulent and deceitful. You don’t always present the truth of who 
 [169]{.pdfpage}  you are and what you are. Maybe you praise yourself and disparage others. 
Judging others? Maybe some comparing? Maybe there is some complaining 
going  on?  Complaining  and  whinging.  Have  a  look  to  see  if  these  mental 
states are arising, note them, know them and let them go. If you don’t find 
your  stain,  it  is  not  only  you  that  has  to  live  with  these  states,  but  your 
friends,  your  family,  your  lover,  everybody  has  to  live  with  it.  You  don't 
want  to  be  the  last  person  in  the  room  to  find  out  that  you  are  angry,  do 
you? When we’re unaware and we become triggered, than we become angry. 
Everyone else can see it, why can’t we see it? Why don’t we stop it? Why 
do we allow it to escalate and become a big problem? Why do we allow a 
tiny irritation to turn into a frustration, get annoyed by that frustration and 
become  angry?  We  may  say  something  unpleasant  to  somebody  else.  We 
may  do  something  unpleasant  to  somebody  else.  Just  because  we  haven’t 
looked at our own mind. Just because we have reacted to an infection or a 
virus, which got into our head. And then what do we do? We blame others. 
«I only got angry because of you!» We blame others, when we don’t see our 
own defilements, our own imperfections in the mind. Have a look and see 
if you have a temper or whether you get angry. When we experience anger 
or resentment, it means that we have a mental resistance towards the object. 
We are trying to push it away. If we are angry with someone, if we look at 
that person again and again, we might even become angrier because we have 
resistance towards that person already. It doesn’t matter what they say or do, 
we are going to find a fault in their speech or their actions.

If we see any triggering, it is the perfect chance to work on ourselves. 
That person who is annoying us has just become our new teacher. We should 
be grateful to them, even though it is difficult. People who give us annoyance  can  really  lead  us  to  understanding  something  important.  We  create 
our own dukkha through our attachments and reactions. Sure, there may be 
someone who says something or does something unpleasant or foolish, but
we alone have reacted to it!
*We alone are responsible for our dukkha!*
It is 
possible to live without dukkha if we are very mindful and aware. We are not 
observing anger to lessen it or to go away. We are observing to understand 
the connection between our mind state and our reactions to the mind state. It 
is our reactions which is our main point of interest. We want to know when 
 [170]{.pdfpage}  our mind has become dyed with a stain of emotion.

Mind  states  are  satipatthana-objects.  We  can  use  them.  Craving  is 
using them to develop a sense of self. Awareness and wisdom can use them 
to develop the mind, to free the mind. All objects are possible. When craving 
can use it for a sense of self, then we can use it for a moment of knowing. We 
can use it to bring us even to cessation. These are legitimate objects of meditation practice. We need to know when our mind has been infected with lust, 
by hatred or delusion. We need to understand these mind states very clearly. 
More importantly, we need to understand our reactions to these mind states. 
We need to check our attitude. Wishing anger to disappear, to decrease or go 
away is wrong attitude. If we find ourselves in an angry state, we don’t want 
it wishing to go away, we don’t want to find ourselves in pushing it away. 
That is just further reaction! We’re trying to use aversion to get rid of anger. 
And that doesn’t work. So how do we deal with things if we find ourselves 
in an angry state for example? We just have to observe the moment. We just 
have to be with it. It doesn’t matter if the anger goes away or not. Anger is 
not the problem. This is conditioned phenomena. Anger is not the problem. 
Our  negative  mental  reactions  when  we  experience  anger  is  the  problem. 
How we react when we find ourselves in this state is what we need to look 
at here. We can react with attachment and identifying going into the story 
further  and  becoming  angrier,  completely  loosing  control,  or  we  can  step 
back  and  develop  awareness  and  wisdom  in  the  moment  having  a  look  at 
that anger, short circuiting the reaction mechanism that happens. Break it, 
shut it off! When we stop reacting to it, that anger stops being dukkha! It’s 
just anger, it’s not me or mine, it doesn’t belong to me, it’s impermanent, it 
arises and passes away. As soon as you hold it or identify with it – dukkha! 
If you can note and know it, disengage and separate from it, using wisdom, 
then dukkha ceases in that moment and there arises a moment of wisdom, 
a moment of clear seeing. Vipassana practice can pull us out of reactionary 
emotional states and pull us out of habitual looping thoughts and tendencies. 
It has the power to do that. We just need to practice it. Putting it in practice, 
we  have  come  here  to  this  retreat  to  learn  how  to  do  this  in  an  intensive 
environment. We try to do this as much as we can in seven silent days. Try 
to get to the point as much, as much as you can. Then when you go down the 
 [171]{.pdfpage}  hill to the 7Eleven-village you can wander around the market and enjoy the 
delights there without getting yourself into too much trouble. Of course, you 
still react, but we have now a technique to step out of our reaction mechanism. We can cool ourselves down, we can calm ourselves rapidly.

So this is important: anger does arise and is part of our conditioning. 
Mind states come up. Emotional states do arise. It’s karma, playing its role in 
our life. No-one can stop karma from giving its resultant. Things are going to 
manifest. It’s not all going to be rainbows and dolphins. Sometimes there are 
troubles that arise. But we can be wise with our reactions toward anger. And 
this is our practice in the present moment. It’s a gradual training and a gradual practice. We are learning how to do it in this retreat, but the real practice 
begins for the rest of your life. See if you can do it, if you find yourself in 
a state of unrest, when you’ve started freaking out about something. That’s 
the time to employ the technique. If we do it in times where the mind is not 
freaking out, then the mind will become very used to it. We’ll have the skill 
to turn and observe something objectively, step back from it and allow the 
let go-mechanism to do its job. It’s all built in, this is how we are designed. 
This is how the mind and body process is set up. It’s very efficient noting 
and  knowing  and  letting  go.  You  can  create  quite  a  wide  space  between 
the knowing and all the mental and physical phenomena that arise and pass 
away not getting sucked into any of them. We can have periods of meditation where nothing comes to stick, it’s all just doing its thing. As we start 
to see the benefits of the practice, there is a great deal of joy in practicing 
in this way. When there is anger and resentment, you’ll find that the feeling 
associated with that anger is very strong – unpleasant feeling. There will be 
some unpleasantness. That’s the aroma, the flavor of unpleasantness. There 
will also be physical sensations occurring in the body when we get angry. 
Because there is strong feeling, they are relatively easy to observe; subtle 
states of craving and addiction are more difficult. When it is something that 
is very unpleasant, of course it’s easier to let go of it. When it’s something 
that is very, very pleasant – more difficult!

Letting go happens in stages: we let go of the past and the future, we 
let go of the external world, we move beyond sensuality, we move beyond 
the five hindrances, we let go of the painful physical sensations, we let go of 
 [172]{.pdfpage}  the painful mental emotions. Then we have to let go of the pleasant physical 
sensations, and yes, we have to let go of the pleasant mental states that arise. 
Everything needs to be let go. The whole lot needs to be chopped up, the 
whole lot needs to be let go. We can’t allow any attachment to stand. If we 
do, it will be a base for dukkha to arise.

There is a direct link between our mind state, mental feeling and the 
physical  sensations  that  arise.  They  are  linked  together,  our  reactions  are 
also linked to them. We described it earlier as the four big stairways leading 
to the pagoda. You can decide which stairway you are going to use if going 
to the pagoda platform.

In our meditation practice we can also choose, if we want to look at 
our emotional state of mind. When it is really strong and we are really struggling with it, we can turn our attention and look at the feelings. The unpleasantness of the emotional state – that’s another stairway. If one stairway is 
blocked, when we are having trouble with it, go around the corner, try to go 
up another stairway. Try to reach the present moment, awareness of the present moment by going through the feeling foundation. If it is too unpleasant, 
have a look at the physical sensations. When we become angry, the physical 
sensations become quite obvious. Our face turns read, we feel warm inside, 
our heart starts beating faster, our breathing quickens and becomes shorter, 
we may start frothing at the mouth. We can be aware of these physical sensations  as  well.  We  have  to  choose  whatever  for  us  is  appropriate  in  the 
moment. Sometimes, if it is a big event or a big experience, we’ll need to 
note all the aspects of it, we need to walk all the stairways for us to let go 
of the experience completely. We’ll have to let go of the physical sensations 
that arise, and the feeling, we’ll have to let go of the emotional state itself, 
and we’ll have to let go of our attachments and reactions of liking and disliking. The fact that it is there. All these things will have to be let go of. From 
the moment you become aware of anger, no matter how weak or strong it is, 
check your mind and body for tension. See if you feel any tensing going on. 
Feel it in the body, it will start to become tense. The muscles start to contract 
a little bit. So hardness starts to occur in the body. The earth element starts to 
manifest in its strong aspect. Hardness, the body hardens.

When we are able to be with anger, that doesn’t mean that we are equanimous. [173]{.pdfpage}  Just because we can sit and tolerate it, «hm, it’s going on», that is 
not equanimity. Sitting there and forcing ourselves to sit through an angry 
mind state, forcing ourselves to sit through an aching knee even, that’s not 
equanimity when we force ourselves. Equanimity has to do with reaction to 
things. True equanimity arises when we are not pushing or pulling, we are 
not attracted nor repelled by the experience. We are completely cool to it. 
It doesn’t matter to us if it arises or passes away. If it’s there and stays for a 
while or if it stays for a week. We have no interest in trying to get rid of it. 
Our only interest is to know it, to see it clearly. We are not trying to push it 
away in any way. We are not just blindly sitting with it. Our practice is going 
beyond that.

So in this process, if we neglect to watch the mind, if we are not aware 
of our mental reaction to an emotional state that is arising, if we fail to realize  that  sitting  with  anger  is  not  the  same  as  developing  equanimity,  then 
we are just going to be dukkhering ourselves, holding ourselves in dukkha, 
maintaining the base that craving has created. We are holding it there.

So instead start to watch the mental reactions to any emotional state 
that start to arise. Try to make some space between the anger and you. It’s 
not yours. Try to use the prism of the four noble truths. The Buddha says,
*«there is dukkha»*
. This is his first noble truth. We can use these words «there 
is». We can put them in front of any emotional state. «There is anger», «there 
is envy», «there is jealousy». Whatever it may be, we can dis-identify with 
it. We can stop identifying with it. We can objectify «there it is», there is an 
angry mind state that has just arisen. It is very different from «I am angry». 
«There is anger». The same experience, one with mindfulness and wisdom, 
the other just blindly reacting and appropriating and identifying. When these 
mind states come up, they are not you. They don’t belong to you. You don’t 
need to take them so seriously. People take their mind states very seriously! 
They  take  themselves  very  seriously!  And  of  course,  they  cause  a  lot  of 
problems those people. Problems to themselves and problems to the people 
around  them.  Making  space  around  our  mental  states,  around  our  mind 
objects is the heart of our meditation practice. We are using wisdom to step 
back. When  we  see  it  as  it  is,  wisdom  allows  consciousness  to  step  back. 
Consciousness is not in there addicted, subjectified, it’s out of that. It’s in the 
 [174]{.pdfpage}  space around it. It’s in the freedom that surrounds the mind state. If we’re in 
the mind state, we’re in the dukkha. If we’re noting it and letting it go, than 
we’re in the space of freedom. Freedom from our own mental afflictions.

So we start to watch our mental reactions to resistance and the anger 
gradually decrease and fade away. When we are not giving it any attention, it 
goes away like a little kid, when we are not entertaining it, not giving it any 
attention, it will find something else to do.

Equanimity  is  the  result  of  truly  understanding  the  nature  of  liking 
and disliking. And truly understanding liking and disliking comes from the 
observation of it, of our evidence, from our own experience, not from someone else telling that you have to stop liking and disliking. That’s not going to 
be powerful enough to do any transformation. That’s a little bit of information you got, a little information contained in knowledge, but it is not strong 
enough for a transformation to occur.

So understanding the difference between equanimity and to bear with 
a mind that is seizing in anger, is very important. When we look at anger or 
resentment directly, and there is no resistance to it, then there is no problem 
in the mind. It’s just a mind state that is there. We are neither upset by it, nor 
disturbed by it. And because it’s not getting any fuel, because it’s not fed by 
craving, it can’t be used as a base for the arising of self, it just passes away. 
It has become redundant. That mental experience is useless to the mind and 
body process. It can’t generate a sense of being and that is all that craving 
wants. So we put a wedge in between our experience and craving. We create 
some space. Then we can truly see the stain in the cloth and wash it out. The 
mind becomes equanimous and sensitive.

When  we  truly  have  equanimity  towards  a  mental  state  like  anger, 
resentment or jealousy – the mind state may still remain there – but there 
won’t  be  any  dukkha  related  to  it. We  won’t  find  it  uncomfortable. Anger 
will be purely an object. It will have been objectified, put out there, it’s not 
me, it’s not mine. It looses its importance and its function and it fades away 
while we look on with equanimity.

So remember that you are not looking at the reactions of the mind to 
make them go away. We are always investigating the nature of our reactions 
so that we can understand them. When we understand them, when we create 
 [175]{.pdfpage}  space around them, then they pass away by themselves. We don’t need to 
push them away.

So try to apply these points, try to observe any emotional states that 
you are going through. Spend the next few days here learning how to look 
at them objectively. When you get back to the busy world, it is much more 
difficult to look at them than in silence. See if you can notice any stains in 
your clothes that you have to do any work with. When we notice what needs 
to be done, this is the beginning of a spiritual life, this is the beginning of 
becoming a spiritual person. We’re not talking about a religious one, we are 
talking about somebody who is doing some work on themselves, who makes 
themselves and the world a more pleasant place to be.

Whatever we learn from dealing with a single mind state like anger or 
resentment can be applied to other mind states as well. Emotions or looping thought patterns, all their relatives and different emotional states can be 
dealt with in the same way, because all have the same structure. Structurally 
they’re the same, their content is different. When we dealt with a certain set 
of circumstances, we have seen that content, the way of letting it go is by 
seeing its structure that holds that content in place. Once we start to observe 
the structure in our present moment experience, it doesn’t matter what the 
picture on the screen is. It doesn’t matter what the emotional state is. It can 
be one of dozens. That’s kind of irrelevant to us, the content is not important. 
Everything needs to be let go of. Of course we can start with the really damaging ones, and then we can start to work on the more subtle ones to refine 
our  experience  of  life. Work  on  the  big  stories  first  that  cause  us  anxiety, 
stress or depression. Fear or worry or concern. Then work on the more subtle 
ones that give us states of unpleasantness.

*It’s important to remind ourselves that emotions are natural phenom-*
*ena  but  they  are  not  your  emotions.*
They  are  happening  in  this  mind  and 
body process. If you identify with them, then they are yours and you have 
to experience them! You dukkher yourself. But if you have awareness and 
the wisdom in the moment they arise, then you don’t have to identify with 
them. You objectified it, they’re removed through the power of awareness 
and wisdom.

When you feel yourself under attack by a strong emotional state, sometimes [176]{.pdfpage}  it’s best not to even look at that emotional state. This may cause even 
more trouble, if our awareness and wisdom are not up to the task. In going 
closer  and  closer  we  may  become  completely  engulfed. That’s  the  time  – 
when a very strong emotion, like when a family member dies, you have very 
strong grief, or you break up with a girlfriend or boyfriend, a strong emotional state – to use another stairway. Have a look at the body. Have a look 
at feeling. Have a look at the unpleasantness or pleasantness of the situation.
When it all becomes completely too much to look at, when all of the 
four foundations seem too much to observe, in that case you can turn your 
mind to a neutral object. Just try to distract yourself from that state. Start 
to watch the breath or start to do some walking meditation. Do a good hour 
of walking meditation, maybe fast walking to clear it out. Pay attention to 
something  else  until  the  emotion  calms  down  a  little  bit.  Not  completely 
disappears, but when it calms down, then you may be able to have a look 
at it properly. When you have weakened it a little bit. When you distracted 
yourself from being in the story so much, then you can have a look. Go and 
jump on your bike and go for a ride, or go for a swim. Calm down and then 
have a look at it. Then you can learn something, it’s all about learning. It’s 
all about knowledge and understanding. That’s how letting go takes place. 
Through wisdom.

The more skillfully you can do this, the more skillfully you will understand that physical and mental phenomena are related with each other, the 
more skillfully you will be able to deal with your experience of life and the 
more satisfying that experience will be.
