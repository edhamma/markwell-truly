# Afternoon Talk



This morning we had a look at some aspects of Vipassana meditation 
practice. Last night we had a look at the formal instructions for the sitting 
meditation practice and for the walking meditation practice. This afternoon 
we are going to have a look at the third main section of our meditation practice here at the monastery, which is awareness of our daily activities.


## Awareness of daily activities


The  importance  of  continuing  our  mindfulness  practice  between  the 
periods  of  formal  walking  and  sitting  meditation  practice  cannot  be  overemphasized  or  stressed  enough.  In  fact,  one  of  my  teachers  used  to  say,
awareness of the daily activities is the heart and soul of the meditator.
*Fail-*
*ing to observe an activity during the day, one ceases to be a meditator.*
Without constant awareness during these periods, there is little chance of developing  enough  stability  or  concentration,  that  will  allow  wisdom  to  unfold 
naturally by itself. It is really the difference between those meditators who 
see the dhamma, who see the truth for themselves inside their own mind and 
body, and those who don’t.

Walking meditation practice and sitting meditation practice needs to be 
backed up by awareness during our daily activities. During our meal times, 
during our chore times, while we are having a rest, while we are taking a 
 [64]{.pdfpage}  bath, while we are walking to the viewpoint or we’re having hot chocolate, 
all of those things. We need to keep some awareness about us. We need to 
keep our awareness in the present moment so that when we do sit, when we 
do walk, we can go quite quickly into the present moment. We go faster, we 
go deeper. Our meditation becomes more consistent. Our practice is more 
continuous.  So  I  urge  and  encourage  you,  during  the  periods  when  we're 
not walking and sitting, please try to maintain your awareness in the present moment, internalizing your awareness, bringing yourself back inside the 
body as much and as often as you can. This will be very beneficial for your 
sitting meditation practice. If you can maintain your awareness in your daily 
activities and in the walking meditation, if you can do that really well, when 
it  comes  to  your  sitting  meditation  your  mind  will  drop  in  quite  quickly. 
More quickly than it would have before.

It is simply cause and effect.
*Vipassana insights are conditioned phe-*
*nomena.*
The causes and conditions need to be continuous. We need to keep 
rubbing those sticks. Don't let there be any breaks. If you're letting there be 
breaks  in  your  stick  rubbing,  then  the  sticks  cool  down. The  friction  isn’t 
created. There's not enough warmth to start a little fire by rubbing the sticks 
together. Our meditation is the same. We need to be as continuous as possible. The  faculty  of  mindfulness  becomes  powerful  and  constant  through 
uninterrupted noting of our daily activities. If we fail to do this, there will 
be  wide  gaps  in  our  mindfulness. The  schedule  is  like  it  is  to  allow  us  to 
practice  as  continuous  as  possible.  The  largest  gap  throughout  the  whole 
day, apart from sleeping time, is two hours between sittings. We try to keep 
you  sitting,  then  walking  or  daily  activities. Try  to  maintain  continuity  in 
your meditation practice. There are many new things to discover when you 
manage  to  do  this.  Doing  things  slowly,  will  help  us.  Slow  down  into  the 
present moment. We perform our activities slowly. It helps us to observe.

The Buddha has given us seven different sections under the heading of
*sati-sampajana*
or  mindfulness  and  clear  comprehension.  These  are  given 
in the satipatthana text under the section of body. That's where we start our 
meditation practice. We are becoming aware of the physical sensations created in the body when the breath flows in and out. The physical sensations 
are  one  type  of  body  experience. We  are  also  paying  attention  to  the  postures [65]{.pdfpage}  of the body. The walking, standing, sitting and lying down. And we’re 
paying attention to the breath that flows in and out. So we're paying attention 
to the body in various ways.

During  the  walking  meditation,  we  particularly  pay  attention  to  the 
soles of the feet and our legs as we’re walking back-and-forth.

During the daily activities our main focus of concern is the whole body. 
The whole posture of the body. We're paying attention to the whole body and 
understand, when it’s sitting, we know that it's sitting. When it's walking, we 
know that it's walking. When it’s standing, we know that it's standing. And 
when it’s lying down, we know that it’s lying down. We understand that the 
body transitions between those four postures throughout the day and we are 
observing that. Always noting, keeping our awareness inside, «Okay, now 
it’s standing. Now it's walking. Now it’s sitting.» Have a look! In our daily 
activities we use this mindfulness and awareness to observe the postures that 
are occurring in the present. Just be aware how your body is disposed at the 
moment. We bring our attention to the body, inside, make sure our awareness doesn't leak outside through the eyes and the ears. We keep bringing our 
attention back to the body as we move around through the monastery. Try to 
keep your awareness inside. Try to keep present.

If you notice that your mind is wandering into the stories of the past, 
make  a  note  of  that,  ‘remembering,  remembering’.  Step  back  from  those 
stories! See that the mind is wandering around in the past. There are good 
memories and there are unfortunate memories. Sometimes we can get upset, 
sometimes we get happy when these memories come up. Just make a note 
of them and step back from them. Stop identifying with them. Allow them 
to  arise,  we  don't  get  upset  by  them,  but  just  make  a  note,  «this  is  what 
this actually happening in the present moment». There is some remembering 
going on. And that's it!

Maybe your mind goes into the future a lot. Maybe you are a planer. 
Planning is occurring. Just make a note of that. Be sure to step away from it.
If you find yourself getting caught in the stories of your mind, make 
a note, you are getting caught. We go into the past all the time. We go into 
the future all the time. It's okay. The mind does this. This is its normal state. 
But we just want to watch it and observe it. We need to keep up with it. We 
 [66]{.pdfpage}  need to be able to note and be aware what kind of mental states are arising 
in the moment. And we step back from them. We note them, we know them 
and we let them go.

We  note  when  the  body  is  standing.  There's  many  opportunities  for 
standing during the retreat. We stand and wait for food sometimes. We stand 
and wait to come into the door sometimes. We stand on the walking meditation path. If our sitting becomes uncomfortable, we can stand up for a few 
minutes  and  then  sit  down  and  again.  Try  to  catch  all  of  these  standings. 
When you're standing in the shower, at the bathroom. Be aware of that. Try 
to maintain continuous awareness of what body posture you are standing in.


## Wise attention


Use the faculty known as
*yoniso manasikara*
or wise attention. It's a 
mental state. Wise attention is the ability to have a look at the reason. Why? 
Why are we doing the things that we are doing? Why are we standing now? 
Why are we sitting now? Why are we walking? Why are we lying down? 
What is the purpose of this? We start to examine why we go into those four 
postures and why we come out of those four postures. Why is it necessary 
to  continuously  change  posture? Why  do  we  have  to  keep  moving  all  the 
time? After  we’ve  been  walking,  we  have  to  sit  down. After  we’ve  been 
sitting for a while, we have to stand up. When we have been standing, we 
want to lie down. Been lying down for a while, we have to stand up again. 
Try to examine your own body and see the reason, why we change postures 
all the time. This mental state, this ability to see the reason why, to see our 
own motivations, to see our own intentions is a mind state that leads us out 
of samsara. It's a very important mind state in the practice of the Buddha’s
teaching.  Yoniso  manasikara.
*Manasikara*
means  attention.
*Yoniso*
means 
‘coming before’, attention as to ‘before states’. Attention to reasons. Reasons why we do the things that we do.

The Buddha teaches us,
*«there is suffering»*. It's the first noble truth.
There it is! He says,
*«I cannot see any single dhamma, that leads more surely*
*to right view then this one.»*
If we want to attain
*right view*, the first factor 
of the noble eightfold path, we want to see things as they really are, we're 
going to need to employ, we're going to need to develop yoniso manasikara. 
 [67]{.pdfpage}  Sometimes we have a reason, sometimes we know why we do what we do. 
It's  not  a  completely  undeveloped  faculty.  It's  very  under-used.  We  don't 
often challenge ourselves for the reasons why we’re doing what we're doing. 
When we start to have a look, we will start to understand what motivates us. 
We start to see it’s the sense of being. This craving to be is manipulating the 
mind and body process. So it gets what it wants. It does what it can always 
trying to take some advantage.

The Buddha also says in the Sabasava sutta:
*«The destruction of the 
taints is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and*
*does not see.»*
Does not know and see what? – Yoniso manasikara. When one 
attends unwisely, unarisen defilements arise and arisen defilements increase. 
When one attends wisely, unarisen defilements don't have a chance to arise
and arisen defilements cease. So combined with
*right effort*
– right effort is 
the  effort  to  remove  defiled,  corrupted,  imperfected  mind  states  of  greed, 
hatred  and  delusion  –  when  we're  trying  to  remove  these  from  the  mind, 
to note, know them and let them go, it's very important that we use yoniso 
manasikara, this wise attention. It will bring us to the reasons of why we are 
trapped in the mind states that we are trapped in. We’ll start to understand 
what motivates our suffering, while we see suffering, while we experience 
suffering.  So  the  abandoning  of  sensual  desire,  the  abandoning  of  being,
the  abandoning  of  ignorance  –  these  three  taints  or  these  three
*asavas*
– 
are removed through yoniso manasikara. Unwise attention is the root of the
rounds of samsara.
*Not paying attention to the present moment and to why*
*we're  doing  what  we're  doing  is  the  fuel  of  samsara.*
That's  why  we  keep 
manifesting as mind and body process in various places and various ways. 
Wise  attention  is  at  the  root  of  liberation.  Liberation  from  the  rounds  of 
samsara. And it leads to the development of the noble eightfold path. In fact, 
the venerable Sariputta answers the venerable Mahakolita’s question about 
right  view  by  saying:  «Friend,  there  are  two  conditions  for  the  arising  of 
right view. The voice of another and wise attention. These are the conditions 
for  the  arising  of  right  view.»  So  we  can  start  to  understand  things  from 
listening,  like  we  do  today.  But  we  come  to  an  even  better  understanding 
of things if we start to investigate for ourselves. When we start to see really 
what is going on in this mind and body creation. The arising of right view, 
 [68]{.pdfpage}  the destruction of defilements is all conditioned by this activity called yoniso 
manasikara.

So we use this yoniso manasikara in our daily activities, combining it 
with the four postures of the body. We use it, we pay attention to it. What 
is it? It's mental advertency. Turning your mind! We are turning our focus 
on to the reasons, our motivations. We're not just blindly following on what 
our mind wants to do. We start to have a look at it. Have a look at the reasons! Why? Are we guided by some selfish idea? Are we being guided by 
an  unselfish  idea? Are  we  guided  by  something  wholesome  or  something 
unwholesome? What is motivating us?

Wise attention or proper attention, adverting our attention, adverting 
our mind so that we can see causes. We want to see causes! We are looking 
at the effects in our meditation practice. The effects are obvious to us when 
awareness and wisdom are present. That's what we are noting. The effect of 
things as they are arising and passing away. Yoniso manasikara goes a little 
deeper. It sees the causes, the reasons and the motivations for why we do 
what we do. Unwise attention can lead us to believe things are all permanent, things are all satisfactory and that all belongs to me, it's all self. This is
*vipalassa sañña*
or a perversity of perception. Vipassana gives us exactly the 
opposite experience. Things are impermanent, unsatisfactory and non-self.

We change the body. I would like you to really have a look at this on 
the retreat. Have a look why we are changing the body all the time! We are 
moving it around. Why do we need to adjust our shoulder sometimes? Why 
do we need to wiggle a little bit? Why do we need to wipe the sweat off our 
face? – It is to cure suffering. That's the reason why we're doing everything 
in our life. To try and escape from dukkha. The Buddha points it out to us 
very clearly. Here's the problem. There is dukkha occurring. If we don't see 
that dukkha occurring, then our daily life is simply about curing our dukkha. 
From morning through the afternoon into the evening. We’re spending the 
day  trying  to  cure  ourselves  from  what  is  very  natural  –  dukkha  arising. 
When we wake up, when we eat, when we wash our body. So have a look 
at when suffering is felt. See it in your sitting meditation practice as well. 
See  if  you  can  feel  it  arising  and  the  need  to  twist  or  change  or  move  or
drink water.
*It's the reason why we do everything that we do*. When we are 
 [69]{.pdfpage}  sitting already for 20 minutes in meditation, we start to become a little bit 
uncomfortable. We feel like we need to change. Why? Why do we need to 
change?  Have  a  look  at  the  reason! Are  you  trying  to  cure  suffering? Are 
you trying to remove the suffering? This is what we have been doing all our 
lives. When we are unmindful, the suffering manifests, we move our body 
to try and cure it in some way. And then the suffering disappears. Then it 
arises again because it's continuous. It's continuously arising. That is what 
having a body is. We have taken rebirth in the sense sphere world. We are 
sense sphere beings endowed with this body. We have this thing, these four 
elements  combined  together  and  consciousness  is  addicted  to  it. Addicted 
to the pleasantness and unpleasantness that arises through the six doors. It 
believes it is this body. It has come to a conclusion that it is somebody. – A 
very interesting conclusion.

The correct practice when you start to feel something uncomfortable, 
when you want to move in sitting meditation is to make a note before moving 
as to why you want to move. Try to become aware of what actually is going 
on. When we are unmindful, we are trying to push away, we are trying to 
escape  what  is  unpleasant  and  we  are  trying  to  replace  it  with  something 
that is pleasant. Sometimes it’s just as easy as stretching your leg. If I am 
unmindful I just transition from one mind state of disliking to another mind 
state of liking. I am pushing away the unpleasant and I am seeking the pleasant, the new posture. This is just reacting to what is there. This is not seeing 
things clearly!

When  we  see  things  clearly,  when  we  are  meditating  and  the  body 
starts to become uncomfortable, we make a note of it, we make a note of the 
sensation that is occurring in the moment, we make a note of the unpleasantness of that sensation occurring in the moment – there is two things going on 
there: one of them is physical, the body sensations are physical; the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the situation is mental – mind and body arising 
together  in  the  present  moment,  consciousness  that  is  there  knowing  that, 
witnessing that, observing that.

Become aware of the aversion that starts to arise in the mind before 
you move. If you can note the unpleasant state that you're sitting in before 
you change your posture, if you can note and know it, you can free yourself 
 [70]{.pdfpage}  from  this  aversion  state. You  can  go  to  the  new  posture  but  you  have  not 
reacted, you make the change. But don't get excited about the new posture 
thinking,  «oh,  I  am  comfortable  and  happy  now».  You’ll  make  a  note  of 
that  as  well.  In  that  way  you’ll  be  noting  exactly  what  is  going  on.  You 
are not just reacting to unpleasentness. That is normally how we function. 
Something unpleasant is happening, we try to escape it! We can escape with 
mindfulness and awareness and wise attention. That's the skillful way. That’s 
the appropriate strategy to use. If we don't have this ability, then our only 
option is sensuality. A little bit of suffering, find some sensual objects to satisfy us. Find something nice to eat, touch, listen, turn on the TV or computer, 
watch  something,  touch  somebody,  to  go  to  new  places  and  get  new  nice 
eye impressions, get fresh delight into the eyes, ear, tongue, nose and body 
doors. That has been our only escape up until now. Unpleasantness occurring, do something nice. That’s what we do moment after moment.

When we start examining our daily activities, when we get up in the 
morning after the bell rang, why do you wash your face? I want you to pay 
attention to that early-morning activity. Why do we need to go to the bathroom  early  in  the  morning?  Make  a  note  of  that.  –  It  is  to  cure  suffering! 
The  bladder  is  full.  It's  starting  to  feel  uncomfortable  now.  When  having 
a shower, why do you do that? Why is it that you need to wash your body 
so regularly? – It’s to cure suffering. The body has become unbearable. It’s 
sticky and all hot. The only way we can cure that is by having a shower. If 
we don't know how to be mindful and aware of what's going on, we can get 
caught up in the unpleasantness of the situation!

There is unpleasantness arising continuously. All we need to do is to be 
aware of it. When we are aware of it, the unpleasantness falls away. There 
is just what is. We don't find anything unpleasant anymore. We are able to 
use our mindfulness and awareness to note it, to see it really as it actually is, 
to not get trapped and caught in whatever that physical sensation is. We can 
move beyond it.

So when changing from posture to posture, do not dislike the old position  and  start  to  like  the  new  position.  You  don't  want  those  mind  states 
coming up. Unpleasantness, disliking. «I have to sit on a stool.» And then 
liking. We are trying to watch our reaction process of liking and disliking. 
 [71]{.pdfpage}  What's fueling it? What's behind it? – Pleasantness and unpleasantness.

Try to maintain your awareness in the present, until another pain or discomfort comes along. And then see what happens. You will have to change 
that as well.


## Labelling technique


So we look at all the activities we go through whilst we are here. We 
have a look at the most simple things. Our daily postures, our daily movements, our eating. In an aid to help us with this meditation, we can use the 
technique of labelling. Using very soft, little words to keep us in the present 
moment if necessary. When something is occurring, we can just put a little 
label  there. To  make  us  aware  of  the  fact  that  hearing  is  taking  place,  we 
can just make a note ‘hearing, hearing’. ‘Seeing, seeing’. ‘Smelling, smelling’. ‘Thinking, thinking’. ‘Remembering, remembering’. ‘Planning, planning’. All these little things. Just watch the mind and make a note of what's 
going on. We are stepping back and watching the mind spinning and turning 
by  itself.  It  will  keep  thinking.  It'll  keep  manifesting  various  thoughts  in 
the  past  and  future.  Just  keep  watching  them.  Just  keep  observing  them. 
Don't get caught by them. We are not going into the story that keeps arising. 
We are stepping back. Meditation is the practice of stepping back from the 
events that are occurring in our lives. Stepping back and having an objective 
view of them. When we step back like this, we disconnect from them. We 
have stopped identifying with them. We don't take the event or experience as 
being me or mine so strongly anymore. The me and mine, the identification 
with the events, the identification with the physical sensations in the body, 
the  identification  with  the  mental  states,  the  emotional  states,  the  thought 
patterns – we start to let go of them, stop identifying with them.

You will find the less you identify, the less you suffer. The more you 
identify, the more you suffer. You can get yourself into a real state, spinning 
around, worrying, freaking out, just by being in a mind state, just by owning 
that mind state. Just by thinking that that mind state is somehow important. 
– Dependently arisen, conditioned phenomena, that doesn't have an owner, 
that arises and passes away. Why do you give so much attention and care to 
a mind state? It's not you! It's not yours! It doesn't belong to you! So drop it! 
 [72]{.pdfpage}  You don't have to hang on to things. You don't have to be the owner of your 
crazy thoughts, your unbalanced emotional states. They are not you! They 
have never been you! They do not belong to you! But we have been identifying with them for a while now. And you know the mind states that cause 
you the problems. Those mind states that take you into depression, anxiety, 
stress, worry, fear, concern. All these mental states are fine when they’re just 
noted, known and let go of. They will arise! It's the nature of having a mind 
and body! Mental states do come and go! Allow them just to arise and pass 
away. Don't get entangled in them. Don't take every thought that comes into 
your head as mine. Don't take all of those things literally or personally. They 
are not yours! They are very, very impermanent mind states that are arising 
and passing away. They don't belong to anybody. It's conditioned phenomena. It's sankharas.


## Karma


*Sankharas*
have arisen because conditions are in place. That's the only 
way old karma can manifest. We have all done billions and billions of old 
karmas in the past. Karma is done through body, speech and mind. Intentional activities.
*Intentional activities that give a resultant, that give a result*
*known as kamma-sati or karmic energy*. That karmic energy remains latent. 
It remains unproductive until the conditions are in place for it to manifest. 
Billions and billions of karmic intentions we have done in the past. Whatever  is  set  up  in  the  present  moment,  will  allow  that  karmic  intention  to 
manifest as a fruit. If the conditions are not in place, the fruit can’t grow. All 
our karmic intentions are like a mango seed which has not been planted yet. 
We cut open a mango seed, you can have a look inside, there's no mango tree 
in there. And yet there exists in that mango seed the potentiality, the possibility, the latency of a mango tree arising from that seed. But there needs to be 
the right conditions in place. There needs to be good earth, some water, some 
good sunlight, maybe a gardener around. If all the conditions are in place, 
then the latency that is in that seed, will have the potential to give its fruit. 
It will start to grow a tree. It will start to give us some fruit. But only if the 
conditions are in place. Our situation is very much like that. Karmic energy 
is  manifesting  in  the  present  moment  bubbling  up  manifesting  as  mental 
 [73]{.pdfpage}  and physical phenomena, arising and passing away in the present moment. 
This is an experience of samsara, this is dukkha. The Buddha said, there is 
dukkha. Have a look at it! When this mind and body process is unable to be 
aware of itself, then it starts to subjectify the experience. The mind and body 
process is either aware and present of the moment, free from a state of duality of me, mine and I and the other. Or it is not present and unaware in the 
moment, not free. We have a choice in each moment. We can be aware and 
free or we can be unaware and trapped in the conditioned phenomena identifying with it. When we're identifying with that phenomenon, that is called 
dukkha. The first noble truth. There is dukkha. The Buddha’s teaching is all 
about removing dukkha. It's all about understanding dukkha. Understanding 
craving, the cause of dukkha and relinquishing and letting it go.

In your daily activities, you can choose a few activities in the beginning and a few things you do regularly. For example drinking water. Try to 
make each drink of water a mindful experience. Don't just grab the bottle, 
open the lid and throw it down. Try to have a look before you start to drink 
the water. What's the condition of the mind? Is there any suffering there? Is 
there  thirstiness?  Make  a  note  of  thirstiness  if  it's  there.  ‘Thirsty,  thirsty’. 
And  you're  going  to  reach  for  the  bottle,  just  be  fully  aware,  watch  your 
hand, move it deliberately, touch the bottle, bring it back, open the lid and 
intending to drink, drinking, tasting, feel the sensation in your mouth of the 
liquid. What does it feel like? Is it hard? Is it soft? Is it heavy? Is it smooth? 
Is it pleasant? Is it unpleasant? Does it make you want more? Does it cure the 
suffering, the thirstiness, you were experiencing? Neither like it nor dislike 
it! See it for what it is!

We spend much of our day going through curing suffering. Why do we 
perform these activities? Why do we eat? What is it about eating that has got 
us so fascinated? Are we eating really just to survive? Or is it some kind of 
enjoyment process? Is it some kind of fun? Are we eating to cure suffering? 
When we are mindful of the eating process, that is the conclusion that you 
will come to. You will come to understand, «Oh, this is why we have to eat». 
If we don't eat, a great suffering is coming. People tend to get upset if they 
haven’t been eating for a few days. They become unbalanced. Very uncomfortable. We start looking at that. How important is eating? Why do we do 
 [74]{.pdfpage}  it? Why do we normally do it? Normally it is some kind of sensual pleasure 
activity. It's become a social activity. We eat even when we're not hungry.

Don’t rush through your activities. «Oh, I do this quickly and then I 
want to go to do meditation.» The meditation is in the daily activities. The 
more attention you can pay to them, the deeper your sitting meditation will 
go  and  the  better  you  can  take  the  meditation  back  into  your  daily  life  as 
well. We’re not only meditating by sitting still and walking very slowly. We 
are meditating on our other activities.

When  you're  going  to  turn  the  body,  intending  to  turn,  make  a  note 
before you turn it. When you hear a sound and then instantly you want to 
look finding out what it is, make a note, why you are doing that. Why are 
you  turning  your  head? What  is  it  that  is  so  interesting  and  requires  your 
attention right now?

When we go to sit down after walking, when we come back to the hall, 
just stand a moment in front of your mat and slowly lower your body down. 
Try  to  follow  the  whole  transition  from  the  walking  path  into  the  sitting 
meditation. There really shouldn't be any gaps. Sometimes people just rush 
to the toilet after the walking meditation and think, «oh I should quickly go 
back to the sitting meditation». This breaks the whole process of awareness. 
Examine that for yourself.

Why do we go to the toilet? Why do we put on clothing? Why do we 
eat? Why do we drink? Why do we turn our head? Do we enhance our sense 
of identity, our personality when we go shopping for clothes? Or do we use 
clothing wisely, to protect and cover our body. Why do we use clothing? – To 
cure suffering! If not we would be really cold. That is why we have to use 
clothing. Or we use appropriate clothing when it's really hot. We are curing 
suffering. That is what clothing is for.

Why  do  we  go  to  sleep  at  night?  Curing  suffering!  Why  do  we  eat 
during the day? Curing suffering! Why do we drink during the day? Curing 
suffering!  Why  do  we  change  postures  continuously  throughout  the  day? 
Because we are curing suffering. We need to be able to see this for ourselves. 
Just listening to it isn't enough. When you see how the mind is maneuvering 
and  manipulating  itself,  so  it  gets  what  it  wants,  it's  always  seeking  some 
kind of happiness. Unfortunately it doesn't know the way to happiness. The 
 [75]{.pdfpage}  way to happiness is contentment. Contentment with whatever is occurring 
in the present moment that leads to happiness. That is the condition for happiness. The proximate cause for happiness. Being content with whatever is 
right now. That makes us happy. When the mind is happy it becomes concentrated. The concentrated mind sees things as they really are.

So make sure you're becoming content whilst you’re here on the retreat. 
Put in some effort to make your mind content. Don't struggle with the frustrations. I know it’s hot. We know that you are tired. We know that you're 
exhausted. Frustrated. «What am I doing here, sitting on the floor, listening 
to this guy? What are we doing?» Try to see the mind making excuses. Try 
to witness the mind as it comes to whisper: «Don't do this. You shouldn't be 
doing that. The beach is better for you.» Try not to listen to that. Don't get 
caught in it. Don't believe the whispers. That is what crazy people do, listening to the whispers in their head. Don't get caught by that stuff. It'll make 
you quite agitated. Whatever is arising, note it, know it and let it go. Here 
it's a radical change in viewing the body and mind process as we're normally 
doing. We don't normally spend our lives looking at what we are doing in 
this way. We are always seeking and searching for something pleasant out in 
front looking for the new enjoyment. A new toy to buy, a new restaurant to 
go to, a new piece of clothing to climb into. All those things. We are looking 
for those continuously.

They  never  bring  satisfaction.  They  never  bring  happiness.  Because 
searching is not contentment. When we are searching and seeking for something, trying to get more and more of something, it means we're not content 
with  how  things  are.  We're  unable  to  just  rest  with  what  is.  The  mind  is 
wanting. Have a look at that wanting mind. Have a look at the mind which 
has a little bit of aversion towards the unsatisfactory present moment. When 
we start reacting to it, there is disliking and we have to change our posture, 
we have to have a drink, or we have to go to the bathroom, or we have to lie 
down. All these things are the results of not seeing clearly what's going on. 
These activities are just what occurs when we are not being mindful.

Of course, you still have to sleep. You still have to drink. No-one is suggesting that you don't. Just do it with some attention to the present moment 
as to why you are doing it. That is a shift in your experience. If you feel any 
 [76]{.pdfpage}  itching sensations or feel uncomfortable pains or any kind of sensations you 
find unpleasant, make a note of that. Don't get caught up by them. «My poor 
knee. Oh my knee.» Stop identifying with it! It's not yours! It’s not you! It’s 
just a physical sensation. It may be unpleasant, that is something else. If you 
see it clearly, the unpleasantness disappears, the sensation will still be there, 
whatever  it  is,  the  sensation  in  your  back,  in  your  knee,  the  sensation  of 
hunger. Whatever sensation it could possibly be. If you just note it and know 
it, you can step out of it. It’s still there but the unpleasantness associated with 
it disappears. It turns into a neutral feeling.

This is how we begin to manage ourselves, we can manage our lives. 
We are learning a technique here, the method and techniques of managing 
our own mind when we find that our mind is getting into a state of unpleasantness, when we are getting into an aversion state or a craving state. We’ll 
be able to note that. «Hm, danger is there. Suffering is occurring.» You can 
step out of it. As soon as you see it, it’s no longer suffering. If you're still in 
it, there's a lot of suffering in there. If you’re still identifying with the experience or the event, dukkha is your companion. If you're noting and knowing, 
letting the conditioned phenomena arise and pass away without identifying 
with it, then you're free in that moment!

Our mediation practice is to free the mind, moment after moment after 
moment. So that we become skillful at it. Like learning to play the guitar. We 
try and make some effort. At the beginning stages it's difficult but after a few 
days you start to play a few accords. Meditation is a practicing event. We 
are practicing meditation! It doesn't happen immediately. It takes practice. 
Bringing our minds into the present moment when our mind is in a state of 
stress. This is a good starting point. When you find yourself worrying, freaking out, maybe you don't understand the meditation, what we're doing here. 
– If that's the case come and talk to me, maybe you're expecting something 
to happen, you've heard people talking about meditation and all the wonderful results and you think you just need to sit down and it's going to happen to 
you. Maybe you think sitting on the floor cross legged with your eyes closed 
is  somehow  miraculously  giving  you  a  great  deal  of  pleasantness.  If  you 
are thinking in that way, you may be quite surprised after a couple of days. 
There's not a great deal of pleasantness of sitting there on the floor. Meditation [77]{.pdfpage}  is mind work. We train the mind. We’re training it to endure, to have 
some skills in dealing with this dukkha that arises.

The Buddha’s first noble truth: There is dukkha. That's all we need to 
understand. If we understand dukkha, we have understood the world. Nothing becomes a problem for us anymore. Because when we see dukkha, we 
also see the cessation of dukkha. We see them at the same time. We see the 
craving that causes dukkha and we see the mindfulness and wisdom and the 
other factors, that cause freedom from dukkha. The noble eightfold path and 
the four noble truths manifest in the present moment together.

When  you  see  dukkha,  you  also  see  the  cause  of  it  occurring  right 
there. And when you see dukkha and its cause, immediately the mind snaps 
out of it and goes into cessation. It ceases! And we see the cause of that cessation  is  our  meditation  practice. The  noble  eightfold  path  is  the  cause  of 
cessation.

We can make our choice in the present moment intelligently. We have 
the ability to monitor each moment. So make the effort. Here we have a special training facility where you can keep your mind in the present moment as 
continuously as possible so you can see these things happening in real-time. 
Once you have seen it, once you have broken through this, it is a lifetime 
lasting insight. It will affect and change your mind and perception. It will be 
a shift. This is called evolution. This is the purpose of our species actually. 
This is why we are here. This is what humans are meant for. We are meant to 
evolve. We are meant to be coming out, evolving. Meditation is the practice 
of evolution. The evolution of our species. Two and a half thousand years 
ago this technique was discovered where beings can escape from samsara, 
the  rounds  of  rebirth,  the  continuous  arising  and  passing  away  of  mental 
and physical phenomena that believe they are somebody. It's all manifesting right in front of us! Luckily the Buddha broke through that. He saw the 
patterns. He saw the framework, the structure and he gave us the teaching, 
pointing out where the problem is and he pointed out the techniques that we 
need  to  use  so  that  we  can  overcome  the  problem. And  people  have  been 
doing that very successfully for two and a half thousand years.

Unfortunately for us, it didn't kind of make it to where we were born 
and grew up. It's taken a while to get over to the western side of the planet. 
 [78]{.pdfpage}  But this century and last century it’s starting to make inroads. The teaching 
is starting to spread into the western hemisphere. So now it's our opportunity to do the practice. Take advantage of this unique situation. This unique 
opportunity to become deeply in touch, not only with a wonderful spiritual 
teaching, but also with your own mind. We're starting to work out what this 
mind is and what its reactions are.

When  we  start  to  see  it,  we  start  to  release  our  identity  with  it.  Our 
identity crisis will start to abate, start to be let go of this identity, this personality that we have created for ourselves. It’s being reinforced by the social 
institutions which we live in. You'll start to see it crumble before your very 
eyes. You'll start to see it crumble through your insight. The sense of self 
will start do dissolve and when it starts to dissolve, a lot of freedom arises.

What  replaces  the  sense  of  self? When  the  sense  of  self  starts  to  go
down, it’s replaced by
*love and compassion, metta and karuna*. That's what 
replaces the sense of self. So don't think that you're going to be empty. Actually there's a great deal of bliss and a great deal of love that arise in the heart 
in the person whose sense of self is being diminished. When you're very selfish, you don't have much love and compassion. When your sense of selfishness starts to go down, your sense of love and compassion for others starts 
to go up. You will start to see that. When we start to let go of our selfishness, 
we start to broaden our interests.

I  really  would  like  you  to  become  aware  of  your  various  activities 
throughout the day. When you're having your meal, listen to the food reflection. Look into your bowl. See the food that is there. Hold the spoon. Pick 
it up. Fill the food in your mouth. What are you doing? You're putting food 
into  your  head! What  for?  Is  it  for  your  enjoyment?  Pay  attention  to  that. 
You're not talking to anyone while we're eating. We are not distracted by any 
screens. Be aware of the arm as it’s bending putting the food into the mouth. 
Feel the warmth, the temperature in your mouth. Feel the softness, the greasiness, oiliness, the crunchiness. Feel that! Feel what it's like to swallow. How 
far down can you follow the sensation of swallowing? Look at the pleasure 
that arises. Is there some happiness? Is it pleasant? Is liking occurring? Try 
to capture all the experience of eating! Try to see exactly what is going on. 
We can also pay attention to our thoughts in our daily activities. Look 
 [79]{.pdfpage}  at our intentions, look at our ideas and imaginings. We’re not getting sucked 
into them either. Look at the planning. Look at the remembering. If you're 
imagining  something,  make  a  note,  ‘imagining’.  If  you're  thinking  about 
something,  ’thinking’.  If  you're  remembering,  ‘remembering’.  If  you're 
planning, ‘planning’. Try to keep on top of exactly what's going on in the 
present moment. Where is your mind at the moment?

We are trying to keep our awareness in the present and internalizing 
our awareness so that we have a continuous awareness of the body at this 
stage  in  our  meditation.  But  there  will  be  thoughts  coming  up  as  well.  If 
they come up, we make a note of them and we return to the awareness of the 
whole body in our daily activities.

It's the same with our sitting meditation. We are watching the breath 
as it flows in and out. That's our main object. That's what we should be pay 
attention  to  90%  of  the  time.  But  if  there  is  some  other  object,  sound  or 
something comes to interfere, we make a note, ‘hearing’. That's what's happening. Hearing is occurring. This body is hearing some sound. That's all. 
Don't get caught in the sound. Don't get caught in the story of that sound. 
Who is making that sound? When will they stop that sound? We don't go into 
stories when we hear a sound. We just make a note that hearing has occurred 
and  come  back  to  our  main  object.  So  we  try  to  keep  our  awareness  and 
attention on the main object.

We  will  be  talking  about  that  more  tomorrow  morning.  We  will  go 
into some further instructions about the walking meditation and the sitting 
meditation.

For  now  I  encourage  you  to  keep  your  mind  in  the  present  moment 
and  internalized  during  the  daily  activities.  It  makes  up  the  third  part  of 
our meditation retreat. We do sitting meditation, walking meditation and the 
daily activities. They all will contribute to your success and your unfolding 
of insight. May it happen swiftly for you!
