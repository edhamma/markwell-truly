## Seventh enlightenment factor upekkha


This morning we’re going to have a look at the seventh enlightenment
factor. It’s known as
*upekkha*
or equanimity. We’ve already had a look at the 
first  three  –  mindfulness,  investigation  and  energy  –  spinning  and  turning 
on each other, doing the work of Vipassana. Then the next three factors start 
to  be  developed  in  sequence  –  the  rapture,  tranquility  and  concentration. 
When these have been developed, the seventh factor starts to come into existence or becomes stronger, starts to dominate the mental landscape. These 
seven enlightenment factors, when they are developed and start to surround 
consciousness, they determine what consciousness knows, and in particular, 
how it knows stuff. So these are the workers, the assistances of consciousness, if you like, and they are actually the factors that cause consciousness to 
awaken. So it’s the enlightenment factors, the causative factors.

Ajahn Chah, one of the foremost meditation master of Thailand from
the last century, says,
*«whatever arises in the mind, let it go, hold on to noth-*
*ing»*. Everything has to be let go of. Slowly but surely, we’re reducing and 
releasing our bind on our mental and physical phenomena and let go of the 
body and feeling, and then we start to let go of our opinions and views. We 
start to shake free from our emotions. We recognize the repetitive thought 
 [247]{.pdfpage}  patterns and looping we get ourselves in. We start to see that stuff more and 
more. And as the practice develops, you start to see it more and more clearly. 
And  through  clear  seeing  the  mind  will  step  away  from  the  identification 
process.  Stuff  still  arises!  Pleasantness  and  unpleasantness  is  still  arising, 
but we have a much better ability to watch it and observe it, not being caught 
in the story of our own mind. We’re freeing the mind, we’re setting it free. 
We’re releasing the mind – just like a bird, when it’s released from a cage. 
We  are  releasing  consciousness  from  mind  and  matter,  from  nama-rupa, 
from the conditional vortex it got itself into. We’re releasing the mind from 
craving  to  be  and  all  these  resultant  defilements  and  imperfections  of  the 
mind that cause cloudiness and dukkha.

As our practice develops, the quality of our equanimity becomes more 
and more natural. Equanimity means calmness or composure. It means evenness, it’s an even mind. Equanimity, it comes from latin. ’equas’ that means 
equal, ’animous’ that means mind. Equal mind. It’s the equal mind. It doesn’t 
sway to the left or right. It doesn’t get pushed by liking nor disliking. Not 
being conditioned by pleasant feeling or unpleasant feeling. It sees through 
the  feeling,  it  knows  feeling.  It  understands  it,  so  it’s  not  conditioned  by 
it.  And  it  doesn’t  lead  to  reactions  like  disliking  or  identifying,  aversion 
or anger. We start to drop that from our experience. Equanimity, when it’s 
developed, gives us an evenness of temper. We don’t get so easily triggered. 
We can be cool. That’s what it means, in the 1960s definition, if you like. 
Yes, being cool with things, that’s what it means. Presence of mind, level 
headedness, equilibrium, balance.

Like a strong tree in the forest, an old tree. It doesn’t get pushed around 
by  the  wind  or  the  rain. The  branches  may  shake  a  little  bit  but  the  trunk 
is  strong.  It  will  become  solid  in  the  sea  of  samsara,  in  the  ebb  and  flow, 
through live’s conditions that we never previously even bothered to look at, 
which will start to become quite clear to us. We start to see how our mind is 
reacting to things and causing us dukkha. Not only do we see it happening, 
but we can also start to do something about it. We can start to free ourselves 
from the reaction mechanism. It is something that we all should have been 
taught when we were children. The educational system, our families should 
see that watching of emotional states, the thought patterns, would save a lot 
 [248]{.pdfpage}  of trouble for everyone if we understood, that we only have to observe our 
mind and stop it from reacting so violently with craving and aversion. And 
then the world would be a much more peaceful place. People would be much 
happier. They wouldn’t be so tense and be caught up in things.

It’s not that Vipassana does bring these states to us! Vipassana doesn’t 
activate  the  five  hindrances  for  example.  The  five  hindrances  are  always 
there! It has been our experience for much of our life, but we just haven’t 
turned  and  had  a  good  look  at  them  before. We  haven’t  used  a  technique, 
where we can observe the mind. Now we are just being aware of them. We 
are noting that they are there and we’re stepping back from life’s true conditions.

So this enlightenment factor of equanimity, when it is developed, can 
bring our life into a much more balanced experience. We are not high on the 
waves, we are not getting sunk down into the troughs. Cruising, on the freeway with the car in the fifth gear, we are cruising. Nothing is really bothering 
us too much.

Equanimity allows us to become even minded towards the four foundations on which we are establishing our mindfulness. The physical sensations, the feeling, the emotions and the thoughts, having seen them, having 
become aware of them, we practice with them. These are the objects of our 
practice. Our practice is to train the mind to become cool with things. We see 
things clearly, so we can let them go. This radically transforms our lives. We 
stop being a pure reactionary machine, that’s just following our instinct like 
an animal. When something arises, we react to it – it’s an immature way of 
existing. And then we start to develop our mind, we train our mind so that we 
can handle whatever comes along. There will be troubles in life. That’s without doubt. There will be big waves coming, smaller waves as well. But we 
need to learn how to ride those waves. We need to be able to swim. We need 
to be able to stand up. If we don’t, we’re going to get crushed. We’re being 
aware  and  not  reacting  to  the  mental  and  physical  phenomena  with  liking 
and disliking, but with equanimity. When we’re not reacting with like and 
dislike, when the mind’s cool with it, whatever is arising, we’re cool, «yeah, 
that’s fine.» We let it go. Then another thing arises and we let it go. We don’t 
become boring by doing this. We slide into a very peaceful and blissful mode 
 [249]{.pdfpage}  of existence. It’s like a duck doesn’t get wet. The water just falls off its back. 
It can exist with swimming or with rain. It’s fine. No problem. It’s like we 
are insulating ourselves from trouble. And we can turn our mind and we can 
activate our awareness in the present and observe our mind state. As soon as 
we know that we’ve been triggered by something, as soon as we know we 
have a little bit of agitation, a little bit of craving or lusting, addiction tendency – as soon as we feel that little trigger, bang, we are on it: we’ve noted 
and know it, we have released the mind from it. It’s by not identifying with 
these processes that one does not react. If we take it «for me» and «mine», 
then things are happening to «me» and «my self». When we’re not appropriating that stuff, then it is just dependently arisen, conditioned phenomena. 
By not reacting one does not create suffering. It’s the reaction process, not 
being cool with things, that makes suffering so intolerable. This is the power 
of equanimity in the present moment. Very powerful, very liberating, releasing the mind from moment after moment from its own problems.

It’s important to emphasize that all our reactions are driven by the sense 
of self. Things that trigger us are not just triggering an impersonal mind and 
body process. It’s triggering a mind and body process that believe they are 
somebody, the mind and body process that has turned to dukkha. When we 
take  things  as  being  «mine»,  we  ever  believe  that  we  own  something  or 
could own something. This is a type of craving, it’s a manifestation of craving. When we take things as «I», «this I am», «this is my opinion», «this is 
what represents me», there’s a believe that this is what represents me. Our 
opinions and views, we like to project them, we like to get them out there. 
Some people like to write them down and publish them. Their opinions and 
views are so important that everyone should listen to them. This is conceit. 
There is a belief that in some way «I am». And thirdly, we come to a view 
«this is my self». We believe that this is what represents me. We believe this 
is who we are. «This is who I am.» «This is truly what I am.»

So these are just views, and they are all based on reactions of liking 
to pleasant feeling and disliking to unpleasant feeling. If we really don’t see 
pleasant and unpleasant feeling arising in the present moment, then we are 
going to be its slave. Feeling has the power to push our mind, to condition 
our mind, to throw us off. We really need to be aware when pleasant feeling 
 [250]{.pdfpage}  is arising. Of course, unpleasant feeling, when it’s arising it becomes quite 
clear to us. «This is a negative, unfortunate situation. I should be mindful, 
note it, know it and let it go.» That is reasonably obvious to us.

What about when it’s a pleasant feeling, the phenomena is associated 
with pleasantness? It’s a little bit more difficult to note it, know it and let it 
go. There is a strong sense of entitlement to this pleasure. «This pleasure is 
mine», «I should be enjoying this», «this is what I have been working hard 
for». So we go into that kind of mode. We go into that mode of appropriation of pleasant feeling but it too needs to be let go of. We need to become 
equanimous towards it. Positive emotional states, like love for example, love 
comes up, it is only associated with pleasant feeling normally. We will have 
all experienced love with unpleasant feeling as well, when we often wonder 
why we’re doing it to ourselves. And there is going to be pleasantness and 
unpleasantness for sure. We need to watch the mind and make sure it doesn’t 
get conditioned by this pleasantness. The power, and love, can become very 
strong. The pleasant feeling will become very strong. We can become very 
attached very quickly.

What does attachment do to the mind? It takes ownership of things. It 
takes things as being «mine». Of course, that leads to tears. It’s attachment! 
It  is  the  root  cause  of  suffering.  Of  course,  there  is  going  to  be  dukkha  if 
you  are  attaching  to  somebody.  Of  course,  it’s  really  something  up  in  the 
air. What’s going to happen to it? It’s going to fall. It’s the law of gravity. 
The law of attachment, if you’re attached to something, you get dukkha. It’s 
a quite simple, linear process: attachment equals dukkha. We don’t want to 
often believe that however.

So be aware how your mind gets conditioned by various things. We’re 
all  used  to  reacting  in  the  same  way  when  we  get  presented  with  various 
situations. We get thrown off. We get turned up side down. All the objects 
causing us problems. We are not watching them. I was once meditating with 
a  friend  of  mine,  an  Irish  monk  actually. We  used  to  meet  every  morning 
before  breakfast.  That’s  the  only  time  when  we  would  see  each  other  for 
the  day,  living  in  the  forest,  quite  separated  from  each  other  and  he  came 
down one morning and said, he had a breakthrough. (We used to just talk a 
little bit about dhamma.) «Really! What’s happened? (That’s kind of things 
 [251]{.pdfpage}  that excites monks.) What’s happened? Something happened in your meditation?»  –  «Yes,  I  have  realized  I  am  only  attached  to  three  things  now.» 
–  «Wow,  venerable,  that’s  fantastic.  Only  three  things. What  are  they?»  – 
And he said: «People, places and things». (big laughter). Ok, that’s a great 
breakthrough. Well done!

Ensured, as long as we are reacting to things, as long as we’re pushed 
and pulled by our mind’s reaction to things, then there is a person who suffers. If we learn to observe directly and objectively, without identifying with 
things, then we reduce suffering. When we have a sense of self and react a 
lot, then we have a lot of suffering. When we have less sense of self and we 
only react a little, sometimes being triggered, but most of the time being cool 
with things, then we experience some suffering and no suffering. If we have 
really a little sense of self and we are pretty cool with our practice and we’re 
not  reacting  that  much,  then  our  experience  is  very  little  suffering.  Only 
major things can come and really upset us. Little things are just whatever.

So you sense the size of your ego and how much you react to the phenomena presented determines how much dukkha you’re going to experience. 
Be aware of this! It’s up to you! You have a choice! In every moment! You 
have a choice if it’s going to be a moment of release or a moment of dukkha. 
So that’s fairly simple to understand but practice, mhh, practice is telling us we have to be patient. We have to know that it is difficult to break 
our  old  habits,  old  reaction  patterns.  It’s  not  going  to  happen  over  night. 
There can be big breakthroughs though, there can be huge letting-goes and 
breakthroughs, huge openings. We open up and release things which have 
long caused us problems and dramas. The power of insight can happen quite 
rapidly but mostly the path is a gradual training and a gradual practice and 
a gradual progress.

When we understand it’s difficult to stop our reactions to things, once 
we’ve been watching our mind for some time, we come to understand we are 
a conditioned being. And that helps us appreciate other beings as well. This 
helps us in becoming equanimous. When we see that other beings are conditioned and they’re reacting, they’re being triggered and they may not have 
undergone  the  training  yet,  the  training  of  observing  the  mind  being  able 
to see things clearly. They may just be in the reactionary stage of life blind 
 [252]{.pdfpage}  sided by reality just reacting to their thoughts and their emotions, pleasantness  and  unpleasantness.  They  may  be  just  pure  reactors. And  it  gives  us 
compassion. We feel empathy toward them and this is a positive mental state 
that can arise. The training not only benefits us but also benefits other people 
as  well  because  our  interactions  and  our  relationships  also  become  more 
balanced. We start to understand how others are trapped. We feel compassion  for  addicts,  for  example.  People  who  are  in  a  looping  state  of  mind. 
Sometimes they even see the looping but are struggling to get out of that. We 
support that. We support people who are working on themselves.

We are all used to reacting in similar ways. Presented with the same situation, we’ll probably react the same way again and again. Habitual. We’ve 
either learned that from our parents or our society – some conditioning is 
learned behavior, some conditioning is old karmic stuff as well.

By remaining equanimous in the moment, we allow old karma to bear 
their fruit without new karma being produced. Just allow whatever is arising 
to bubble up to the surface. We’re cool with it, we note it, we know it, it’s 
gone. It’s gone. It’s gone. Whenever you feel yourself triggered or trapped 
by an emotion or a thought pattern, note it and know it. Step back from it. 
Allow vast layers of defilement to arise to the surface and pass away without 
reacting.

On  this  topic  we  can  mention  here  the  precepts.  Following  the  five 
precepts, or we have been taking the eight precepts here in the morning. An 
extra three. Normally the eight precepts in Buddhist culture are reserved for 
the full moon days and the new moon days. – Yes, it’s ironic here on Koh 
Phangan, I know. The irony does not escape us – but once a fortnight, two 
times a month we keep the eight precepts. Normally we just do five precepts. 
Five precepts can, while it may seem a little bit moral or a little bit religious 
or  sound  like  someone  saying  something  to  us  from  a  mountain,  we  shall 
follow this and that – what the five precepts are actually doing is setting up 
the conditions for the old karma that’s going to arise. When we arrange the 
conditions  in  our  life,  when  we  maintain  not  killing,  stealing,  sexual  misconduct, lying and use of intoxicants, when we can maintain these precepts, 
then what we’re doing is setting up the conditions for which old karma can 
come. Old karma can only manifest if there is conditions in place. If we put 
 [253]{.pdfpage}  good conditions in place then the karma that can come is going to be good 
stuff. If we don’t break the precepts, then what we are doing is effectively 
not opening any doors for unwholesome karma to come and manifest in the 
present. We’re blocking it with virtue. This is the beauty. This is the beautiful fragrance of virtue. We can manage which karmas start to attack us. Not 
completely, not fully but we can definitely organize our lives in a better way. 
We  can  limit  the  damage,  if  you  like,  and  promote  the  wholesome  in  our 
lives. When  we  live  a  more  virtuous  life,  you’ll  understand  that  suffering 
is diminished by this practice. Virtue is a practice. Nobody is just perfectly 
virtuous and a wholesome person. We all have to practice these things. We 
receive some instructions from our families and society on what is suitable 
and  unsuitable,  but  mostly  it’s  about  practicing  ourselves.  Witness  it  for 
yourself when you keep the precepts. Make a note of it: «Ah, the day is good 
or the day is bad.» Does good karma give its fruit or does bad karma give its 
bitter fruit? See how these things are conditioning each other. Stuff can only 
arise when its conditions are in place. When this is, that comes to be. With 
the arising of this, that arises. It’s impossible for this to arise if the conditions 
are not there. When we break the precepts we put conditions in place for all 
kinds of stuff to come up. So be aware of that. Particularly if you’re planning 
to do some long meditation retreats. Purify your virtue before you do so.

The enlightenment factor of equanimity actually refers to a balancing 
of energy. We are balancing stuff. It’s a state of mind which in the center 
of  our  experience  is  inclining  to  neither  one  extreme  nor  to  the  other,  not 
inclining to attachment or clinging or craving or liking and it’s not inclining 
towards aversion or anger or frustration or irritation or disliking. It’s cool 
with  whatever  is.  In  our  meditation  various  states  of  mind  are  competing. 
You may have noticed that sometimes the wandering mind is taking control, 
sometimes it’s mindfulness, other times the energy is weak and we become 
lethargic, shoulders lower, back rounds. We get into that kind of ‘waiting for 
the bell’-look. Faith tries to overwhelm our intelligence or our intelligence 
thinks it’s much too clever for everything. It starts trying to look for holes 
in the Buddha’s teaching listening attentively to try to find some errors or 
mistakes  in  the  Buddha’s  teaching.  I  wish  you  good  luck  with  this.  I’ve 
been searching for that, it doesn’t exist. The teaching is very complete! Our 
 [254]{.pdfpage}  effort competes with concentration. Balance in these pairs of mental states is 
essential to maintain our direction and progress in our meditation practice.

We  develop  equanimity,  this  is  not  something  that  just  comes.  It’s  a 
mental state which is to be developed and it gets stronger and stronger. It 
may start a little bit weak, not fully exercised or trained. Maybe we’ve had 
no need to exercise any restraint or control over our reactions before. Maybe 
nobody even told us that we should stop reacting in such a way. Equanimity 
is the ability to control our reactions. This is the heart of meditation practice. 
This is how we reduce our experience of suffering in our daily life. In our 
worldly life this is part of the practice that we use to really make big changes 
in our life, to transform our experience on a daily level. We can really use 
this noting and knowing to let go and free ourselves from emotional states, 
to not become frustrated or irritated when we’re having a conversation with 
somebody we don’t like or who’s opinion we don’t care for. We’ll be able to 
tolerate that person without becoming frustrated or bored with them. Ok, we 
can deal with various things.

Most of all, we can deal with ourselves. We’ll be able to deal with our 
own internal reactions. The world is fine as it is. Things are arising and passing away. Some things are pleasant, some things are unpleasant. It is as it is. 
It’s unfolding naturally according to its dhamma. Natural law. We can create 
big problems for ourselves if we’re not willing to follow this natural law. If 
you want to fight against gravity, then get ready to start lifting stuff. We’ll be 
spending our time lifting things up trying to break gravity. That’s what we 
try to do in our meditation practice. We don’t want to be breaking the laws 
that are naturally in place. We want to be flowing with them, understanding 
what they are, knowing that this path leads to the cessation of suffering and 
this reactionary path leads to dukkha, leads to all kinds of self-opinions and 
self-views. We  can  form  quite  ridiculous  opinions  about  ourselves  just  by
looping  in  a  mind  state.
*«Whatever  a  monk  frequently  thinks  and  ponders*
*upon, that will become the inclination of his mind.»*
We start thinking about 
things, we’re reacting to things and we’re unaware that we’re reacting. What 
we’re actually doing is conditioning our mind over and over again to react in 
a certain way. And if that reaction process results in strong dukkha, then you 
should be prepared. If you’re unwilling to work with your reaction processes 
 [255]{.pdfpage}  than you just have to crop all the dukkha that comes your way from reacting. 
So our practice is to very much develop equanimity. This is useful in 
our seated meditation practice on a retreat such as this. The development of 
equanimity leads to even deeper states of mind, even deeper states of clarity 
and seeing, the more prominent letting go, lots more freedom. In our daily 
lives  we  can  pull  ourselves  out  of  little  troubles  that  we  meet  on  a  daily 
basis. Little frustrations. People push in in the 7Eleven queue or taxi drivers 
try to rip us off. 20 baht or 50 baht. Instead of exploding, we can become 
cool  with  those  things.  We  start  to  understand.  It’s  better  just  to  be  cool 
with things. «But it’s the principle!» Principles and views cause even more 
dukkha when you’re holding on to your view or opinion about something. 
Yeah, they are great dukkha-makers, those ones! Turn on your opinion and 
views and see how much dukkha you can attract. We need to let go of this 
stuff. We need to let go of this. But because we’ve been reacting so much 
throughout our lives, it’s difficult to turn this boat around. But it’s possible. 
Gradually and surely, we start to free the mind from our opinions and views. 
So  the  characteristic  of  equanimity  is  balancing.  It  balances  the  corresponding mental states.

It’s function is to arrest the mind before it falls into an extreme of liking 
or disliking, craving or aversion. Equanimity is right there in the moment if 
we  develop  it.  It’s  there  in  its  undeveloped  state  but  if  we  can  develop  it, 
it becomes stronger. It starts to overwhelm the other states. It starts to balance the mental states. It starts to bring them together and then one can free 
oneself from the dukkha. It fills in where there is some lacking and if there 
is some excess it balances that out. It sees where problems are being made, 
where reactions are being created, what the real causes of the reactions are. 
It sees that all reactions are based on egoic reactions. It’s always the «me» 
that’s reacting. The mind and body process don’t react by themselves. They 
are pure nature. When there is no «me» then there is no reaction. It’s gone, 
no further production or generation of karma.

When  upekkha  is  strong,  there  is  total  balance,  no  inclination  of  the 
mind to sway left or right to like or dislike. It’s very happy to sit right in the 
middle and be balanced. It seems as if mindfulness is taking care of everything.  When  these  enlightenment  factors,  the  seven  enlightenment  factors 
 [256]{.pdfpage}  come together as a team, they become very powerful. The simile in the text 
is given of a chariot or a carriage with three pairs of horses in front, so six 
horses. Two, two, two. The driver of the carriage is mindfulness, awareness 
to the present moment, attention to the present moment. On the right side, we 
have the energizing states. Energy, investigation and piti or rapture. These 
states  energize  the  mind,  excite  the  mind,  fuel  development.  On  the  other 
side, we have the calming or tranquilizing states. The states of tranquility, 
concentration and equanimity. These horses on both sides have to balance 
each other out. And this is what we do in the mind. Energizing, noting and 
knowing, letting go, tranquilizing, calming things down, becoming equanimous – these things are working together. This is samatha and Vipassana. 
Samatha  is  calming  states.  Vipassana  is  knowing  and  seeing  states.  They 
work together as a team, elevate consciousness out of dukkha.

We bring equanimity about through wise attention. Attending carefully 
to the moment, seeing the causes and the motivations behind our actions and 
reactions,  if  we  are  continually  mindful  from  moment  to  moment  without 
a  break  based  on  the  intention  to  be  equanimous.  This  is  how  we  do  our 
practice.

Wake up one morning and say today is a day of equanimity and cruise 
through it. See if you can watch your mind. Count your reactions. See how 
many go on the aversion side. How many frustrated, irritated little triggers 
arise. See how many of them you react to and see if you can count any you 
don’t  react  to,  in  which  equanimity  has  arisen. Try  to  manage  your  mind. 
Keep a score if you like. And on the craving side of things, notice the tendency  of  the  mind  to  react  to  wanting,  to  craving,  to  desiring.  These  two 
functions  of  the  mind,  pushing  and  pulling.  Do  that  for  a  day  and  have  a 
look. Be supremely mindful and attentive to the moment and to your mind 
and watch what’s happening. You may be surprised. You’ll learn a lot. You’ll 
definitely be able to monitor your mind more successfully after you’ve done 
this  exercise. You  will  have  seen  your  nature.  It  may  not  be  pretty.  Don’t 
chastise  yourself.  Don’t  be  upset  with  yourself,  if  you  notice  that  you  are 
a supreme reactor. Taking everything in and getting upset or getting super 
excited  about  it.  Be  aware  of  what  is  happening.  Be  happy,  with  the  fact, 
well, while there is reaction going on, at least you know it’s going on. At 
 [257]{.pdfpage}  least you’re one of the few people who can see reactions happening in yourself. And you’re on it walking the path now. You’re doing the work that has 
to be done and we’ve all got different types of work to do.

Equanimity doesn’t arise easily in the mind of beginning meditators. 
Especially on the retreat, all of you will have experienced zero equanimity 
perhaps  on  the  first  two  days.  Remember  those  reactions.  Remember  how 
we were resisting, dukkhering ourselves. There is nothing wrong with the 
mind’s reaction. Once we go through a few of those events, we start to see 
the nature of the mind reacting. We start to see dukkha. When we experience 
dukkha,  we  know  dukkha  and  then  we  can  let  go. The  mind  will  become 
balanced  for  a  while,  and  then  it  goes  off  and  reacts  to  something.  Don’t 
become upset with this. It’s been doing this for a long time. It takes time to 
make changes. Give yourself the space, give yourself the time. You’re not 
going to become perfect over the weekend. It takes time, training and effort, 
practice.  Once  equanimity  is  activated,  then  you’ll  see  the  difference,  the 
quality difference it makes to your life. This enlightenment factor is really 
one  which  makes  a  huge  difference.  It  really  cools  us  out.  It  changes  our 
life, if we can just put it into practice. Now we’re here learning it. The real 
practice comes when you’re going down the hill and we’ll talk about that 
this afternoon. Eventually, we practice equanimity on a daily basis like this. 
Eventually, it develops and becomes stronger to the point where we can call 
it an enlightenment factor. It’s become strong enough, that it qualifies that 
we can watch mental and physical phenomena arising and passing away.

We  should  try  to  be  equanimous  towards  all  living  beings.  To  creatures, to animals, we shouldn’t react to people. We become cool with people. 
Just know that beings are conditioned. There are many different types, many 
different  old  karmas  running,  streaming  along.  Sometimes  people  can  be 
awful. Not because they are an awful person, but maybe because they had an 
awful day. Maybe yesterday was just unbearable for them so they’ve woken 
up feeling a little unpleasant. Don't react to them. And to the different places 
you visit. Things are different in different places. You may have noticed in 
your travels. That’s what makes traveling so interesting. Going to another 
country and seeing a whole group of people completely conditioned in the 
same way. They believe the same things. They do things in the same way 
 [258]{.pdfpage}  as  each  other.  Observe  the  conditioning  of  people.  We’re  all  conditioned 
beings. We can become equanimous, when we realize that. Not all people 
have  undergone  the  same  conditioning  processes.  In  fact,  there  aren’t  any 
two people who have undergone the same conditioning processes. We’ve all 
been conditioned in different ways. So make space for that fact in your mind 
before  you  become  upset  with  somebody  or  before  you’re  quick  to  judge 
them, before you start reacting to them. Before you start reacting and judging a place and generalizing an entire community or an entire nationality of 
particular  behavior  or  activity.  Develop  some  equanimity  towards  places, 
and  the  things  as  well,  animate  objects.  Become  cool  with  stuff.  Don’t 
become upset when things get broken or when things get damaged. This is 
their nature, things are impermanent. We can’t expect things to last for ever. 
If we’re expecting things to last forever, that means we aren’t seeing things 
as they really are. Nothing lasts for ever. Nothing lasts even for a second. It 
may repeatedly come into our mind however. Thoughts of things, addictions 
to things, cravings for things, or repulsion towards things. So these people, 
places and things, we need to develop equanimity on a wide and broad scale. 
Most in the little things that are happening and in our meditation practice. As 
our practice develops equanimity becomes stronger and stronger.

We should point out that equanimity is not insensitivity. It’s not indifference. It’s not apathy. It’s not the kind of mind that says, «oh well, that’s 
just  your  bad  karma».  We’re  not  developing  indifference  towards  people. 
We’re still caring. We’re not just becoming still, and «oh, so that’s just your 
bad karma so you should deal with that, I’m not going to react to it». We’re 
not becoming that kind of person. That’s not equanimity, that’s indifference. 
That’s insensitivity. It’s a lack of empathy. No! Real equanimity is a decision 
not to react to things. It’s simply non-preferential. It doesn't make choices of 
regarding some things better than others. We don’t push things aside that we 
dislike. When something we dislike arises in our experience, in our world, 
we  acknowledge  it. We  accept  that  it’s  arisen. We  note  that  it’s  there. We 
come to terms with it. We deal with it in our mind. We accept it, «oh, well 
look at that». Smile to yourself. Acknowledge that in the past you may have 
got angry or upset about this. But now, you don’t. See the development! See 
how the mind is changing and becoming trained. The mind rests then in an 
 [259]{.pdfpage}  attitude  of  balance  and  acceptance  of  the  way  things  are. We  see  the  way 
things are and we accept the way things are. When we accept, we become 
content and when we are content, happiness arises. This is the path to happiness. Becoming cool with everything. The hippies were right. Let’s become 
cool and all groovy. Fine.

When equanimity is a factor of enlightenment and it’s present strongly, 
we abandon both attachment to things and disliking of things and this is the 
path to the end of suffering. It doesn’t mean that we don’t enjoy life. Don’t 
misunderstand this. There still will be objects associated with pleasantness. 
They will arise, this is our karmic legacy. Enjoy them while they’re there. 
Taste the sweetness. Enjoy the coolness, whatever it may be. Enjoy the sensual touch. Enjoy! But don’t attach! Don’t use that object as a base for your 
personality, for your sense of self. Don’t react and hold and cling. ‘Pleasantness is arising’ is ‘pleasantness is arising’. There it is! Liking is occurring. 
There it  is! And it stays for a while. This is its nature. And  then  it passes 
away – this is also its nature! We don’t get upset when pleasant things pass 
away, and we don’t get upset when unpleasant things arise. It’s all going on 
as it should be! It’s all nature unfolding naturally. It’s all dhamma. We can 
become cool with everything and we find ourselves living with a mind that’s
being released from dukkha. You can do it! My teacher used to say,
*«you can*
*do it in this very life!»*
He did it in this very life. It’s quite possible. We just 
need to train the mind.

Think of all the things we do to train ourselves. Think of all the years 
we've  spent  in  school  listening  to,  sometimes  dubious  subjects  that  have 
little  to  do  with  our  live  or  have  any  interest  to  us. We  spend  time  doing 
that! How many exams do you sit? How many semesters did you go to the 
lectures and listen, write all that information, remember and study it, pass 
the exam. As soon as the exam is finished – into the bin with a lot of it. «Oh, 
that  stuff.»  Completely  useless.  Won’t  need  to  do  any  statistical  analysis 
ever  again.  It’s  gone.  So,  we  spend  ourselves  training  doing  that  kind  of 
stuff. Why not spend some time actually training the mind to give yourself 
a truly better life.

Somehow we think having a job will make our life better. Of course, 
you have to earn a living in some way preferably with right livelihood. But 
 [260]{.pdfpage}  have a look at the effort in our lives to train ourselves and see the results. 
Was it truly important that kind of training? And have a look at the training 
that should be done, to make our lives not only tolerable, but blissful as well. 
There is a lot of bliss when we are in the present moment and the mind is 
equanimous.

So equanimity is of tremendous importance, both in the practice and 
in everyday life. We generally either get swept away by people, places and 
things, reacting, dukkhering ourselves – we get ourselves worked up into a 
state of agitation and distress, we allow our mind to get into a loop of craving 
and wanting trying to satisfy the unsatisfiable, running after cravings little 
wants. Be gentle when you notice this happening in your mind. Be careful 
when you notice this conditioning. This is a long-term project that we are 
undertaking, training the mind. The sooner and the more regularly we do the 
practice, the less dukkha you’ll have in your life. It’s about training.


## Third jhana


As  our  meditation  practice  unfolds,  we  start  to  develop  deeper  and 
deeper  states  of  concentration. Yesterday,  we  started  to  have  a  look  at  the
jhanas. These states of meditation, part of
*samma-samadhi*, the four jhanas. 
Yesterday we looked at the first and the second one seeing how these deep 
states of stability result from letting go. We let go of the sensual pleasure. 
We let go of unwholesome states like the hindrances. We let go of the past 
and the future. We let go of the external world. We stabilize our attention in 
the present moment internalized, watching physical and mental phenomena. 
We let go of the pleasant or the unpleasant physical phenomena. We let go 
of the unpleasant mind states. We let go of thinking! Until we get our mind 
into  such  a  state  where  the  momentum  is  constant,  our  awareness  is  well 
established, the body and mind are experiencing piti, rapture and happiness. 
We’ve entered into the second jhana, which is comfortable and concentrated 
and we start to see things as they really are. There is an internal assurance 
about our practice.

But as we keep developing, particularly with the enlightenment factor 
of equanimity, our meditation practice progresses even further than this.

*«And furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, he remains equanimous, [261]{.pdfpage}  mindful and alert still sensing pleasure with the body, he enters into 
and abides in the third jhana on account of which the noble ones announce, 
equanimous and mindful he has a pleasant abiding. He permeates and pervades,  suffuses  and  fills  this  very  body  with  the  pleasure  divested  of  rapture, so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by the pleasure 
divested by rapture.»*

So  rapture  at  this  stage,  that  fourth  enlightenment  factor  that  we’ve 
developed to get into the first and second jhanas start to be let go of in the 
third  jhana.  In  fact,  we  need  to  let  go  of  it.  The  electric  buzz  of  piti,  the 
excitement, the thrill, the pleasure of piti starts to be noted and known. We 
recognize its function to energize the mind and energize the practice. And 
we notice that what it does, is make things very interesting and enthusiastic. 
But we also notice, that this too, is a little bit shaky. It’s still not supremely 
stable. We take a look at the photo we’ve taken when we’ve been experiencing piti, it’s still a bit unfocused. The piti is still disturbing the image a little 
bit. And as we keep practicing, noting and letting it go, the fifth enlightenment factor of tranquility starts to become more and more powerful. It starts 
to overcome the piti. It starts to cool the piti down. Piti doesn't completely 
disappear, but it gets overwhelmed by tranquility and the pleasure that arises 
from piti, the pleasantness, the vedana of piti gets replaced by the vedana of 
tranquility. It’s another type of pleasantness, another type of vedana but it’s 
more subtle. Instead of being an excited state of mind, instead of being on 
the dance floor, we’ve transitioned to a nice lounge and we start to relax. The 
mind goes into a comfortable, calm couch or sofa. The body becomes very 
comfortable. The pleasure that arises is deep and cool. The mind stabilizes 
and enters into the third jhana. There’s equanimity arising now. The mind 
has become equanimous. It’s not perfect though! That pleasure is still a little 
bit agitating. Even though it’s cool, even though it’s calm, there is still some 
pleasantness there.

The  instruction  of  the  Buddha  is  to  fill  and  suffuse  and  pervade  this 
body with the pleasure that arises independent of rapture. That is the pleasure that arises from tranquility. We suffuse, we fill this body with this tranquil  pleasure. The  body  becomes  still,  super  still,  super  calm.  Completely 
balanced. You won’t want to move, even an eye lash, you’re so comfortable. 
 [262]{.pdfpage}  And  this  is  an  experience  of  the  third  jhana.  The  nobel  ones,  the  sangha, 
those members of the community, who have managed to break through to 
the dhamma, even they say the third jhana is the most perfect. There’s a great 
deal of pleasure. A great deal of spiritual pleasure. A pleasure which goes far 
beyond the little bits of excitement we can create with the body or mind in 
sensuality. The sensual states don’t even compare.

The Buddha gives us a simile:
*«Just as in a blue, white or red lotus 
pond, there may be some blue, white or red lotuses which born and growing 
in the water, stay emerged in the water, flourish without standing out of the 
water so that they are permeated, pervaded, suffused and filled by the cool 
water, there being nothing from their tips down to their roots unpervaded by*
*the cool waters.»*
Even so we take this pleasure and fill the body, permeate, 
pervade, suffuse and fill this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. 
Nothing of this entire body remains unpervaded by the pleasure divested of 
rapture. So this cool and calm state – piti is left behind in the lower jhanas – 
another thing has been let go of and we move to a state of much bliss, much 
happiness, a lot of happiness, a lot of calmness, a lot of stillness and stability. 
Very pleasant states of mind.


## Fourth jhana


But even this is not the end. Even this has to be let go of. You’ll be 
attached to it. It will make you cry when you have to let go but do it and go 
to the higher state!

*«And  furthermore,  with  the  abandoning  of  pleasure  and  pain,  with 
the earlier disappearance of joy and grief, he enters into and abides in the 
fourth jhana, which has a purity of mindfulness due to equanimity with neither  pleasure  nor  pain.  He  sits  permeating  the  body  with  the  pure  bright 
awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by the pure 
bright awareness just as if a man was sitting wrapped from head to foot with 
a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white 
cloth did not extend. Even so a monk sits permeating his body with the pure 
bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by the pure 
bright awareness.»*

So when we start to let go of not only the unpleasant physical phenomena, [263]{.pdfpage}  unpleasant mental phenomena, we’re starting to let go of the pleasant 
physical phenomena, the piti, and we’ll start to let go of the pleasant mental 
phenomena,  sukkha,  happiness,  the  pleasure.  We’re  letting  go  of  almost 
everything. We’re really letting go of things, attaching to nothing. And when
this happens our mindfulness becomes perfected. We have
*samma-sati*. This 
is the perfection of mindfulness due to equanimity. It’s the equanimity that 
gives  it  its  perfection.  It’s  the  perfect  state  for  observing,  for  noting  and 
knowing,  it’s  the  perfect  state  for  breaking  through  to  the  other  side. The 
mind is still and calm. The other factors have been performing their duties. 
We become still. We become quiet. The mind becomes very, very radiant. 
Lightness and brightness accompany it. We can shine it throughout the body. 
In fact it starts shining out through the pores in your skin. There’s an experience of the fourth jhana. It’s the perfect state for awakening, for breaking 
through.

Now, this is how the development of the seven enlightenment factors 
comes to fulfill the noble eightfold path. All the factors of the noble eightfold 
path are developed through these enlightenment factors. In fact, the noble 
eightfold path manifests when the enlightenment factors are fully topped up, 
when they’ve all been trained and developed. When they’ve all been trained 
and developed we see very clearly dukkha, we see the cause of dukkha, we 
see the end of dukkha, and we see the path that just made this happen. The 
four noble truths are exposed to us and we awaken in the moment to how 
things really are.


## Determined striving


When we’re doing the training – there is a wonderful text here:
*«Deter-*
*mined striving»*
– it’s up to you how much you want to strive, how far you 
want to take this teaching. We’ll talk about this this afternoon. But it’s up to 
you do decide how far you want to take it. How far do you want to progress 
in  this  very  brief  birth  experience,  in  this  very  brief  life?  How  far  on  the 
path can you make it? This is all we have to do. This is all our evolution. 
All the rest is just fluff and non-sense. Just the stuff of «me» and «mine». 
Just stories about «me», about «mine». Identity development and personality growth. And then we die! And then we start it again! With a new body to 
 [264]{.pdfpage}  attach to and a new identity and a new nationality in a new physical location. 
And  we  start  to  develop  that  one  again. We  develop  our  identity  until  we 
have a full load of dukkha and then we die. And then we do it again! New 
circumstance, new body, new experience. Craving is still the same. We got 
into the habit of dividing things up temporarily, into a time sequence. We 
believe  that  there  is  a  past  and  a  future. We  believe  that  there  is  this  life, 
and that there is possibly past lives or future lives. Some of us believe that. 
Some of us are not quite there yet, haven’t understood how the conditional 
structure is operating. Don’t worry about that. Deal with this existence! Try 
to make as much progress as you can.

*«And  how  is  exertion  fruitful,  bikkhus?  How  is  striving  fruitful?» 
«Here  bikkhus,  a  bikkhu  is  not  overwhelmed  with  suffering  and  does  not 
overwhelm oneself with suffering. And he does not give up the pleasure that 
is  caused  with  dhamma,  and  yet  he  is  not  infatuated  with  that  pleasure.»*
He does not give up the pleasure that is caused with dhamma, and yet he is 
not infatuated with that pleasure. We don’t have to give up all the pleasant 
things! We just don’t have to become infatuated with them. Infatuation leads 
to  attachment. Attachment  leads  to  dukkha.  So  enjoy  the  nice  things  that 
come into your life! And let them pass away. Don’t try and hold on to things. 
Empty  your  bag. You  want  to  travel  around  with  a  30  kilo  backpack  or  a 
five kilo backpack? Which one is lighter? Which one is more comfortable? 
Which one will give you dukkha? The more stuff you got, both physically 
and mentally, the more stuff you’re holding on to, the more dukkha you’ve 
got. So open up your backpack and start to throw things out. Removing all 
those old attachments, the old things we’ve been clinging to. Old modes of 
being and old modes of existence. Maybe the use-date of these old modes of 
being is over. They don’t have to fulfill those functions anymore. You’re not 
a student at school, you’re not living at home with your parents, you don’t 
have to fulfill all those little things anymore. You can start to drop things. 
You can empty your load.

How do we strive?
*«He knows thus, when I strive with determination 
this particular source of suffering fades away in me because of that deter-*
*mined  striving.»*
This  is  activating  our  awareness  in  the  present  moment,
noting, knowing and letting go. This is satipatthana.
*«And when I look on 
 [265]{.pdfpage}  with equanimity, this particular source of suffering fades away in me while*
*I develop equanimity.»*
This is the enlightenment factor that we are developing of equanimity. So he strives with determination in regard to that particular source of suffering which fades away in him because of that determined 
striving through noting and knowing, and he develops equanimity in regard 
to that particular source of suffering which fades away in him while he is 
developing equanimity.

So the process of eliminating dukkha from our lives is a two-fold one: 
determined striving and looking on with equanimity. «Determined striving» 
is doing the practice, keeping your mind in the present, noting and knowing and letting go. That’s our determined striving and then we look on with 
whatever has arisen, whatever is there, we observe it with the mind through 
equanimity.

*«When he strives with determination, such and such a source of suffering fades away in him because of the determined striving. Thus that suffering 
is exhausted. – Finished! – And when he looks on with equanimity such and 
such a source of suffering fades away in him while he develops equanimity. 
Thus the suffering is exhausted in him. This, monks is how exertion is fruitful*
*and striving is fruitful.»*


In this passage we can see that the two activities of noting and knowing and the activity of equanimity development are very useful in removing 
dukkha from our lives. Two ways! We note and know and we become cool 
with it. And then something else arises. We note and know, we become cool 
with it. Whenever a particular source of suffering arises, perform this dual 
activity.  Perform  this  meditative  practice  in  your  mind  and  see  the  suffering fade away! See it disappear! The power of awareness and wisdom and 
equanimity is much stronger than the power of defilement. Defilement will 
be washed away if we can activate our awareness.

So this is the completion of our discussion of the enlightenment factor 
of equanimity. This afternoon we’ll have a look at some practices we can do 
in our daily lives when we leave this place. Things we can do to activate the 
dhamma in our life after the meditation retreat.
