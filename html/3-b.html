<p>We are going to have a look at a few of the enlightenment factors, the
<em>bojjhangas</em>.  These  enlightenment  factors  are  given  by  the  Buddha  in  the
fourth section in the satipatthana text, the section under dhamma-nupassana
or contemplation of mind objects. The five hindrances are also in the same
section. They are the unwholesome mind states that come to surround consciousness and cause us so many difficulties. As we develop those four foundations of mindfulness in our meditation practice, these seven enlightenment
factors start to be developed as well. These seven enlightenment factors are
mental states of mind that we develop. They are wholesome states.</p>
<p>The first one is mindfulness,
<em>sati sambojjhanga</em>.
<em>Bo</em>
means ‚to know’,
Bodhi  or  Buddha.  To  know,  to  become  enlightened.
<em>Anga</em>
is  a  causative
factor. So bojjhanga is a causative factor of enlightenment, of knowing.</p>
<p>The seven enlightenment factors will need to be developed during our
meditation practice. Consciousness, the knowing gets surrounded by these
seven enlightenment factors. They are the ones that are doing our meditation
work and they will eventually elevate consciousness out of samsara, out of
dukkha and into cessation.</p>
<section id="first-enlightenment-factor-sati">
<h2><span class="section-number">8.1. </span>First enlightenment factor sati<a class="headerlink" href="#first-enlightenment-factor-sati" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><span class="pdfpage">133</span>   Mindfulness is the generally accepted translation of sati. But we can
also  use  awareness.  One  of  my  meditation  masters  used  to  use  the  words
<em>observing power</em>. He thought that was much better to describe the faculty of
mindfulness.</p>
<p>Mindfulness  is  dynamic  and  confronting.  Mindfulness  leaps  onto  its
objects,  covering  them  completely,  penetrating  them  and  not  missing  any
part of the objects.</p>
<p>The  characteristic  of  mindfulness,  this  state  we  are  activating  in  the
present  moment,  is  non-superficiality.  Mindfulness  sinks  into  its  objects.
When we direct our awareness to an object, the task of mindfulness is to drag
consciousness to the place of knowing. If we’re looking at the rise and fall
of the abdomen, awareness will drag our consciousness, our knowing, to the
place and sink into the movement of the abdomen. It sinks in, it doesn’t float
on the surface. It’s non-superficial. It’s penetrative. Awareness takes us into
the object so that we penetrate it. Some may have started to experience it
with the breath, coming closer, closer, closer, until it comes up right in front
of it. You feel like you’re inside the breath. It’s confronting. Up in your face
like that. The object and the mind start to join together in our experience.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is non-superficial. It’s deep and profound. It doesn’t float
on the surface. A cork thrown into a river just floats on the surface, a stone
thrown sinks into it, into the object. This is what mindfulness does. It sinks
into it so that other mental factors, such as wisdom can do their job, specifically wisdom does seeing things clearly and letting them go. Mindfulness
ensures that the mind will sink deeply into the object.</p>
<p>The  function  of  mindfulness  is  non-disappearance.  That  means  we
don’t forget what we are doing. It doesn’t disappear from the object. We’re
trying  to  be  firm. We’re  not  forgetting  or  allowing  our  object  to  disappear
from our frames of reference. The object is noticed, and noticed, and noted
and noted and not forgotten about. We don’t forget in the middle of a breath
and start wandering off. Mindfulness is not yet established if that is happening. We sink into the object, we stay there and the object doesn’t disappear
from our view. Mindfulness drags our consciousness into the present so that
it  knows  just  that  object  that  mindfulness  has  selected  and  gone  into.  We
<span class="pdfpage">134</span>  need to be firm to put our mind in the abdomen area so it doesn’t slip off.
We may have to repeatedly put down our mind into the abdomen area. We
have to reestablish it. We have to constantly reactivate our awareness at the
abdomen. We  are  training  our  mind  so  it  knows  what  it’s  doing. We  keep
sending the mind there, keep sending it there, keep sending it there. Eventually, it knows exactly what it’s doing and it will start to go there by itself.
Like taking a dog to the park, the dog starts to know the way, it doesn’t need
a leash nor to be told. Our mindfulness is the same. We train the mind. Our
mind starts to go there, to the abdomen automatically. Even when we do our
daily activities, you may find your awareness coming spontaneously to the
rise and fall of the abdomen.</p>
<p>The  manifestation  of  mindfulness  is  confrontation. We  will  know  it,
because the object is right up there, right close to us. We’ve come right in
clear to it. You will feel that you are deep down inside the body surrounded
by your abdomen. You are in there! You are confronting it. In the beginning
stages we start to get kind of a feeling, well now it’s extended, now it’s contracted, it’s expanding and contracting and then we start to see a few more
subtle  things. And  then  finally  we  start  to  see  it  very  clearly  indeed. This
is what is happening whilst we’re directing our awareness to the abdomen.</p>
<p>We are constantly sending it there, we are focusing, we are being firm,
and  we  are  trying  not  to  slip  off  it.  When  the  mind  penetrates  these  processes, when it can stay with the movement, then it starts to really understand the nature of the four elements. It sees the hardness, it sees the pressure, it sees the tension and the vibration. All these elements are manifesting
quite clearly at this stage to the mind. You will come to the understanding
that  you  are  definitely  not  this  body. This  body  is  something  but  it  is  not
you. You will come to an understanding that it’s not mine, this I am not, this
is  not  myself. You  will  come  to  an  understanding  this  is  actually  quite  an
unsatisfactory predicament we have got ourselves in. You will see the nature
of what it really means to be infested with a body. We had it foisted upon us.
We have to have this thing! So we start to see more clearly. We start to see
its impermanence, we see the unsatisfactory nature of it, and we actually see
that it is not us anyway. It is this thing we have to carry around with us and
care for. Clean, feed, sleep. We start to see it as it really is.</p>
<p><span class="pdfpage">135</span>  When  mindfulness  confronts  an  object,  it’s  like  it  doesn’t  see  it  so
clearly in the beginning stages. It’s like there’s somebody at the end of the
road. You can see that there’s someone there but you can’t make out if it’s
a man or woman. You can’t see their face at all. But as you get closer and
closer, then the details start to become clear. You can start to see its face. You
can start to see if it’s someone you know. As you get closer and closer you
get to see more details about that person.</p>
<p>This is what mindfulness is like. It’s not superficial. It’s not vague or
blurry. It’s quite clear and quite distinct. Mindfulness sinks in its object. This
is the function of sati sambojjhanga. To bring us into the present moment
and sink into the object. It’s that mental factor which pulls consciousness, the
knowing, into the present moment and sinks into an object so it can realize
the nature of that object, note it, know it and let it go.</p>
<p>So we have to apply a sharp degree of care. We have to look meticulously at our object of observation to understand its true nature. When we
can bring ourselves face-to-face to the rising and falling of the abdomen, the
details will start to appear by themselves and the practice will start to bear
some fruit.</p>
<p>Once we repeatedly face the object, and when there is no misses, the
object won’t be easily forgotten, you’ll understand its true nature. And you
will be able to, not only develop mindfulness, but hopefully be able to stabilize that mindfulness. We’ll make that mindfulness so continuous, that it
becomes a state of samadhi. Continuous awareness, stability, or a concentrated state of mind.</p>
<p>When  we’re  developing  this  awareness,  this  mindfulness,  it  builds  a
very  strong  barrier  to  the  arising  of  other  defilements.  Greed,  hatred  and
delusion and the five hindrances seem to get swept away, once mindfulness
starts to show up on the scene. It has a lot of power in the mental scene and
those hindrances, that arise continuously, start to be suppressed for a little
bit. We start to move them out of the way. When we move them out of the
way, we can start to see what is actually going on with the mind. It’s because
of these five hindrances, that the mind is covered by all kinds of distractions,
all kinds of foliage that we can’t see it clearly.</p>
<p>You will start to feel a state of ease and comfort once mindfulness is
<span class="pdfpage">136</span>  being established because the defilements won’t have a chance to enter. They
are temporarily suppressed. You will find that just that by itself is a pleasant
experience. Just being free form the five hindrances is a wonderful experience. Just that. And we go even further. Once we start to develop, once the
hindrances are gone, then you will start to see the true nature of the mind.</p>
<p>When  mindfulness  is  persistently  and  repeatedly  activated,  then
wisdom can do its job as well. We start to have insight into the true nature
of  the  mind  and  body. We  see  the  individual  phenomena  and  we  also  see
the general characteristics of all phenomena. Impermanence starts to show
itself. Dukkha is revealed. Non-self, a frightening experience, reveals. When
you realize, that actually this body is not me, it’s quite a shock. I shouldn’t
say it’s frightening, but it can be quite a shock. It’s a deep insight with profound implications. You start to realize that this thing is not you. You stop
identifying with it. Even if it’s just for a moment, you start to see things quite
differently.</p>
<p>So the cause of mindfulness is nothing more than mindfulness itself.
The more we practice it, the more we can develop it, the more it gets developed by itself until it becomes continuous, or what the Burmese would call
you reach a stage of momentum, where mindfulness, wisdom and awareness
are almost automatic. We almost don’t have to activate them anymore. They
are just there, staying there. The Thais call it
<em>maha sati</em>. The Burmese call it
<em>momentum</em>. We can call it
<em>continuity of awareness</em>.</p>
<p>So  the  development  of  mindfulness  is  simply  a  continuum.  One
moment after the next moment, moment after moment. We are inclining our
mind  towards  activating  this  state. At  this  stage  of  the  meditation  retreat,
this has been pretty much what we have been doing for the last few days.
We have been activating our awareness to the present moment, bringing it
in our body. We are trying to establish our awareness on the body. We are
trying to establish our awareness in the body so that we can see it for what it
really is. How we can do that is by accessing these sensations that are arising throughout the body. When we start examining these sensations, then we
come to a state of concentration if we can practice continuously. This state of
observation, this state of mindfulness starts to become concentrated. Things
start to become clear.</p>
<p><em><span class="pdfpage">137</span>  As a meditator the only task is to be aware of whatever is arising in</em>
<em>the present moment.</em>
This is our main thing, this is what we are doing here.
Everything else is very much a secondary activity. Activating and maintaining our awareness in the present moment is our priority until this enlightenment factor of mindfulness can be fully developed. So I encourage you to
put aside any other activities.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">8.2. </span>Third enlightenment factor viriya<a class="headerlink" href="#third-enlightenment-factor-viriya" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The third enlightenment factor is known as
<em>viriya sambojjhanga</em>. Viriya
means  energy.  The  first  three  enlightenment  factors,  mindfulness,  energy
and  investigation  are  the  mental  states  that  are  doing  the  work  of  meditation. They are doing the job of activating awareness, sinking into the object
and then knowing it by letting it go, letting it go after it’s been known. But
the third enlightenment factor energy is the energy expended, that we use in
activating our awareness into the present. Mindfulness pulls us to the present
but we need to activate it. And this effort that we make of keeping coming
back to the present moment is what we mean by energy here. It is a mental
effort. It is the effort to be constantly here and now. The effort to be meditating. The effort to be aware. It is the effort that we make when we notice
that the mind has wandered, started thinking about stuff, we bring it back
to the present. This is strong effort when we are constantly doing that, then
we are going to develop this enlightenment factor that will take us all the
way. If we are still not doing that, if we’re still allowing the mind to wander
here and there some times, if we are still not being a strict parent parenting
our mind correctly, then we are going to end up with a mind that wanders
and goes here and there. We have to take care of the mind. We have to train
the mind. This is what energy is about, directing our mind consistently and
persistently and continuously towards the present moment and the object of
our observation.</p>
<p>In the old Pali books, viriya is described as the state of the heroic ones.
People who are hard working, who have the capacity of doing stuff, they can
be heroic in whatever they do, wherever. We need to have a lot of effort in
meditation. It’s not a matter of just coming into the hall, sitting down, closing our eyes, and «ok, come on insight please arrive and land on me.» That’s
<span class="pdfpage">138</span>  not going to happen. We need to put the right conditions in place. And those
right conditions contain effort. So it’s effort itself that gives people a heroic
capacity. It’s just their effort that makes them successful.</p>
<p>The characteristic of effort is an enduring patience in the face of difficulty. When we experience difficulties or troubles, it is effort that stands
up to the trouble. We put forth effort, we try to train the mind, we try to be
patient. We try to tolerate. It’s the ability to see to the end whatever one sets
one’s heart on. We decide we are going to do something and we are going to
work and we are going to do it. This kind of effort. Even when it is difficult.
Even when we are tired, bored and lonely. It’s the effort that we put forth to
achieve our goal.</p>
<p>So  patience  and  acceptance  from  the  very  beginning  of  the  practice
is very important. We need to accept that it is not going to be an easy ride.
Some of us had easy lives. Things come to us easily. We are intelligent, we
cruised through school. Someone gave us a good job. We collected a bit of
money. Things have been relatively easy for us. The only way to find out
how tough we are is when we try to stand-up to the difficulties of life. When
we  start  to  have  some  stress. When  we  start  to  have  some  worry  or  some
concern or our mind starts freaking out a little bit. That’s when we need the
effort and the energy to be tolerant to endure what is going on in the mind.
It’s the ability to grip one’s teeth right through to the end what one starts.</p>
<p>On a retreat like this we sleep much less, sitting motionless on the floor
in the heat cross-legged. Your mind is dissatisfied thinking about all those
sensual pleasures that you’re missing out. Lots of things going on here in the
mind whilst we are on retreat. You need courageous effort to forebear these
difficulties. If you raise your energy level than your mind gains strength to
bear with it. Of course, you can swing around your leg when you have pain,
but try to keep it a little bit longer. Train your mind in patience and forbearance.</p>
<p>Effort has the power to refresh the mind and keep it powered. There
is a lot of energy that we use in our meditation practice but once it starts,
mindfulness starts, you may not be able to sleep before midnight. You are
lying there wondering what is going on. So tired all the time and now you
can’t sleep. This is just mindfulness starting to come into practice. It’s starting <span class="pdfpage">139</span>  to be continuous. Once mindfulness is turned on, it’s difficult to turn it
off. Thankfully! This is particularly drawn out in a longer retreat. You will
see how energized the mind can become. Sleep, whilst still necessary is very
much a secondary interest of the mind of a long-term meditator. The mind
becomes sharp, alert and clear. In fact it gets a lot of rest from just being in
samadhi. It replenishes itself. We don’t need so much sleep.</p>
<p>The enlightenment factor of effort has the function of supporting the
practice. It supports the mind when it is under attack. It is very important to
have some encouragement and some inspiration. Not only from yourself but
from the group here. You will find that meditating in a group can be much
more powerful.</p>
<p>Our meditation practice does take a great deal of energy. We really do
have to work to establish continuity of our awareness. We do need to keep
activating our awareness. Keep pulling ourselves back inside the body. Keep
pulling ourselves back into the present moment. As soon as we’ve noticed
we have gone out, bring it back! Don’t hesitate. Chop off the conversation
that  you’re  having  with  yourself  or  your  friend.  Stop  thinking  about  those
plans that you have been making. Tell yourself that you will be able to think
about this stuff later. Now is not the time! Now you have deadlines to meet!
You have work to do. It’s not the time for idle fantasies or imaginative journeys. Thinking and pondering about stuff is not going to take you anywhere.
That’s not what we’re here to do.</p>
<p>When the Buddha spoke of energy as being a kind of heat, when the
mind is filled with energy, it becomes hot to dry out those hindrances. When
we are noting and knowing and letting go, noting, knowing and letting go,
the mind becomes very hot. Any of those defilements or any of those hindrances in the mind are just blown away. It dries out like a stick of wood, as
a simile in the text goes. Our defilements simply can’t compete with an energized  mind.  When  we’re  activating  our  awareness  in  the  present  moment
continuously,  these  five  hindrances  are  blown  away.  We  have  the  tool  to
remove them. And the tool is in our own mind.</p>
<p>If our effort is strong and the mind can vaporize defilements, the mind
will  vaporize  defilements  before  they  can  really  touch  us.  In  putting  forth
<em>right effort</em>, the sixth factor of the noble eightfold path, we are doing four
<span class="pdfpage">140</span>  things: two on the negative or unwholesome spectrum, two on the positive
or  wholesome  spectrum.  Our  energy  or  right  effort  is  to  ensure  that  any
unwholesome  states,  any  of  those  hindrance  if  you  like,  that  have  arisen
already, we get rid of them. Note them, know them and let them go. If they
haven’t arisen yet, we block them from arising by maintaining our awareness in the present. And on the wholesome side, if these enlightenment factors haven’t yet arisen, we put forth effort and put the conditions in place for
them to arise. And if they have already arisen, we put forth effort to develop
them further and strengthen them and grow them until they come to complete fulfillment.</p>
<p>So  we  are  overcoming  and  avoiding  the  unwholesome  and  we  are
arousing  and  developing  the  wholesome  states.  And  these  enlightenment
factors are on the side of the wholesome. An energized mind can jump from
one object to the other with ease and quickness. Once we develop the right
level  of  energy,  we  will  be  able  to  easily  do  the  practice  of  ‚rising,  falling, sitting, touching, rising, falling, sitting, touching’. The mind will know
where  it  is  going,  it  will  be  internalized,  it  will  be  present,  and  it  will  be
able to jump from object to object. In fact following it around quite closely.
So our awareness and these objects of the body come quite close. We don’t
loose track of them. The mind is very interested in what it’s doing. There is
a great deal of enthusiasm and interest, when our energy is fully activated,
activating our awareness into the present moment. This is the type of energy
we are talking about here.</p>
<p>When we can do this, defilements are blown away. The mind becomes
clear.  Clarity  increases.  There  is  a  brightness  in  the  mind.  It  starts  to  see
things  as  they  really  are.  Energetic  mindfulness  allows  us  to  deeply  penetrate into the object of observation. It doesn’t allow the mind to scatter and
wander way.</p>
<p>With energy we are activating our awareness, noting what’s there. The
second enlightenment factor, investigation can be activated quite clearly. We
are activating our energy, we are increasing our mindfulness and so it penetrates, and then wisdom does the job of letting go. We are noting, knowing
and letting go. We are activating our awareness, noting what is there, allowing wisdom to wiggle ourselves free from our attachment to that object, and
<span class="pdfpage">141</span>  it’s passing away. Then we’re repeating the process over and over again until
the mind stabilizes and gets still in this way of watching the mind and body.
It’s not a reactionary process. We’re not reacting with liking or disliking. We
are just observing and allowing the mind to disengage from that stuff, from
the  mental  and  physical  phenomena  that  keep  arising  and  passing  away.
That’s stuff that doesn’t belong to anyone and yet, we are very, very busy of
trying to hold on to it and try to create an identity. We are trying to create a
life out of it. Craving for being is trying to establish itself. That’s all craving
wants to do. Craving wants to be. It very much wants to be something. You
may have been able to see that in your life already. In various stages of our
life we really want to be something.</p>
<p>So energy is at times essential. If a meditator can’t muster the effort to
confront his own defilements, or confront a difficult mind state, if you can’t
really sit there and look what is going on in your mind, you’re going to get
stuck! You’re  going  to  start  cringing  and  cowering. You  can’t  sit  and  look
at the nature of your own mind. You need to be able to do this. You need
to be able to observe it objectively without getting caught up in it. Without
being freaked out by the nature of your own thoughts. Without following the
thoughts. Very often we get stuck in this story of our thoughts. We totally
believe  our  own  stories.  In  fact,  we  make  up  stories  for  us  to  believe  and
delude ourselves. We create nonsense and then try to believe it. We try to
think that there is some happiness in that. Of course, it very rarely is. If it
is, it’s only very momentary before it passes away and we are on the search
again for something else to give us some happiness, to give us some meaning, to give us some being.</p>
<p>Craving for being is the cause for suffering, and yet, all we do our lives
is entertain this notion of craving to be, wanting to be, becoming. On this we
have focussed our life so far. Constantly going after new things to become.
«I want to become a sailor. I want to become this, I want to be this, I want
to  be  that…»  because  that’s  the  only  way  we  know  how  to  get  pleasure.
Our only way – up to now! Real pleasure comes from a concentrated mind,
a mind that is still and bright, knowing. There is great deal of pleasure into
that. The pleasure of a sensual world fades in comparison. It’s like comparing a bowl of dog food on the floor that’s been there for a few days with one
<span class="pdfpage">142</span>  of our nice meals. There is really no choice, is there?</p>
<p>So for effort to be developed to the point of being a factor of enlightenment, it must have the quality of persistence. We need to be persistent in our
effort, we need to keep going, keep being persistent even when troubles or
blockages come, even when we have a little freak out, when an emotional
state really throws us. Be persistent! Keep noting and knowing and you will
break  through  it.  Sometimes  it  takes  six  or  ten  times  to  note  a  particular
emotional state to note it and truly let it go. Sometimes it takes longer. You
have to keep working with some states because they have become habitual.
Our long ingrained habits that we have been reacting in the same way to the
same object for 20 years now. So we have a reaction cycle and process in
place. It takes some effort to break this, but it’s evidently breakable. We can
move beyond the trap that we have set up for ourselves. So with persistent
effort the mind can be protected from its wrong thoughts.</p>
<p>This enlightenment factor blows the third hindrance, laziness and boredom, out of the water. Once energy is established, we can really start functioning quite clearly in our practice.</p>
<p>The Buddha was quite brief in describing the cause how energy arises.
He says it is from wise attention. Paying attention to the cause of energy creates energy. When we realize the cause of what we’re doing, when we see
our motivation for what we are doing – that is desire to escape from samsara
– when you see the impermanence and the unsatisfactoriness of this mind
and body process, it does arise in the mind a state known as
<em>samvega</em>. It is
the desire to escape from the conditioned realm, the desire to move beyond
this  very  impermanent,  dependently  arisen,  conditioned,  impersonal  mind
and body process. It’s the desire to escape from it. To move out of it. This
is called evolution. This is the evolution of our species. And this is what the
Buddha was hailed for in his time. Someone who broke through, broke out
of the mind and body process, broke out of dukkha, broke out of the identification with the mind and body process.</p>
<p>So this is the type of effort or energy that we need if we’re going to go
to practice wholeheartedly. I wholly recommend, that you put forth as much
effort and energy as you can to just activating your awareness in the present moment. Just keep coming back. It doesn’t matter if you’re getting any
<span class="pdfpage">143</span>  results. It doesn’t matter if anything is happening. Don’t be discouraged. I
assure you the conditions that we have been putting in place for the last few
days, will start to show their results in a very short period of time – if you
have been doing, if you have been consistent in the practice.</p>
<p>The three enlightenment factors energy, mindfulness and investigation
start to spin on each other. Noting, knowing and letting go. These start to do
the work and then the other enlightenment factors will start to be developed.</p>

<section id="painful-sensations">
<h2><span class="section-number">8.3. </span>Painful sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#painful-sensations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Some of you will be experiencing some aches and pains in your body
and  you  may  be  wondering  how  you  can  deal  with  them  in  this  meditation practice. You may be thinking, «I can’t mediate because of the pain. I
really can’t concentrate my mind.» Those physical sensations are part of the
practice as well. This is a good way to develop the enlightenment factor of
energy. The Buddha said, that unwholesome intention leads to resultants that
are experienced as painful feeling. So if you have been experiencing a few
painful feelings or a few painful sensations, I think it is save to say that there
has been some unwholesomeness going on. And this is karma.</p>
<p>Our experience of physical sensations is not so bad when compared to
a dog for example. Imagine having a body like that. It is covered in fur and
has got creatures living in it. When we get a single ant walking on our arm,
we start screaming. Imagine having hundreds of flees living on your body
consistently. So our physical sensations are not so bad. Others have it much
worse than us. But still physical sensations will have to be dealt with, if we
are to be successful in our meditation practice.</p>
<p>By now you should have all had a few physical sensation that are painful. If we keep our posture changing all the time, then we will keep disrupting the flow of our practice. So we have to learn to sit still. We are going to
have to learn to sit for 45 minutes or longer. On the first couple of days, you
may feel it will be impossible. But towards the end it will be better.</p>
<p>Try to manage your pain, that we don’t constantly react to it, that we
don’t constantly shuffle around. Stay with a physical sensation that is painful
for a while and just see if you can note it. See if you can become aware of it.
What  is  it  that  makes  these  sensations  unpleasant?  It  is  just  the  four
<span class="pdfpage">144</span>  elements  balancing  themselves.  Just  the  ratio  is  changing.  Various  things
are  going  on  in  the  body  all  the  time,  changing  here  and  there.  The  four
elements are just manifesting as physical sensations in the body. Investigating a very strong or powerful sensation can be a very wonderful meditation
object, can be a very unique experience in the life of a meditator, when we
start to practice with physical sensations. Because the five aggregates arise
together and pass together, awareness can take different perspectives of the
same present moment experience. We can look at the sensations that are created or are occurring in the body. We can have a look at the unpleasantness
which is a mental state. This is also occurring at the same time. These are
two different things. There is a physical sensation of aching, or throbbing
or hardness – that is one thing. And there is an unpleasantness that is in the
mind.
<em>The sensation is in the body, the pain is in the mind.</em>
These two things
arise together, exist together and pass away together. They are two separate
things. They are mind and matter. Consciousness is that which knows what
is going on. These three are arising and passing away together. We can activate  our  awareness  and  wisdom  in  that  present  moment  and  see  how  this
physical sensation and how this painful feeling do arise together. And in fact
we can separate them and see them clearly. Indeed we will need to do this in
our Vipassana practice to progress.</p>
<p>So if we have been slow in noting a physical sensation, it very quickly
turns into something painful. It becomes accompanied by a mental feeling.
We appropriate it and call it mine. «My painful knee!» Three things going
on there. Knee is a concept. Pain is unpleasant, we start to call it mine. We
start to hold on to something that is unpleasant. We started to identify with
something that is unpleasant. So we shouldn’t wonder why we are experiencing suffering if we are holding on to something that is associated with
unpleasantness. All we need to do is drop that. Drop the holding, we won’t
experience the feeling as unpleasant anymore.</p>
<p>If someone puts a ball of hot metal in your hand, we shouldn’t keep
holding it and complain, «oh it is hurting». If we hold on to it: «Oh it is mine,
it is my emotional state, and I will keep on holding to it as long as I can and
give myself dukkha as long a I can.» That is quite often what we do with
emotional states. They arise and we hold on to them, burning ourselves. We
<span class="pdfpage">145</span>  need to learn the practice of letting them go. And this practice with physical
sensations can help us to do that. There are two different strategies to deal
with painful sensations.</p>
<p>The first one is as follows. You are noting, knowing letting go, ’rising,
falling, sitting, touching, hearing’. We do this cycle 90% of our time. But
when something distracting comes, we need to note that object. We put our
mind  into  the  knee  and  go  to  the  most  concentrated  point  of  that  sensations and burry the mind into the knee. And we make a note of whatever the
sensation is, ’throbbing, bouncing, hot’. Just acknowledge that this is your
present moment experience. Don’t go into the knee and identify with it. «Oh
it’s  my  knee.» And  then  just  come  back  ’rising,  falling,  sitting,  touching,
rising, falling sitting, touching,…’ and then go back again to the knee, where
the sensation is strongest. ’Aching, aching, aching’. And then stay there for
a  moment  and  see  what  happens  after  you  made  the  note.  There  are  four
possibilities that can happen: a) the sensation will increase, b) it decreases,
c) it completely disappears, d) it changes places (e.g. it goes from the knee
to your back. I don’t know why it does this, how it does this; it is scared to
the noting mind perhaps). Then continue ’rising, falling, sitting, touching,
rising, falling sitting, touching’, then come back. Until the mind let’s it go.
Do  this  four,  six,  maybe  ten  times.  Note,  know,  observe  the  change!  We
incorporate the physical sensation into our practice.</p>
<p>The second requires more effort and concentration and is for dharma
warriors. It should only be done on painful physical sensations of our practice not on old injuries! Meditation pain you recognize that it goes away after
standing up. In case of old injuries don’t do this kind of practice. ’Rising,
falling,  sitting,  touching,  rising,  falling  sitting,  touching,…’  then  we  send
our  mind  to  the  place  where  the  sensation  is  the  strongest.  We  stay  there
and drill in, like an electric drill into the physical sensation, bbrrr. We are
not identifying nor getting angry. We stay with the physical sensation. We
are using it as an object for awareness and wisdom. Hold the mind there, it
can  be  a  strong  sensation.  Hold  your  mind  there,  ’aching,  aching,  aching,
aching’. Just watch what happens. Then go in there again in the most concentrated part of the physical sensation. We are keeping going into it, holding it there, holding it there, you may start to tremble, to shake or to sweat
<span class="pdfpage">146</span>  a little bit. Don’t worry about that. Stay there, stay there. If it’s too much
come to the ’rising, falling, sitting, touching, rising, falling sitting, touching’. Then go in again, drill into it, like an electric drill, bbrrrrr. Stay there,
keep gently noting. Don’t identify my pain – this is very important. Noting
it, noting it, noting it – until boom! (slap) it disappears. It snaps. Our experience shatters. The physical sensation is still in the body but our experience
of the sensation comes out of the body as an ephemeral experience. There is
a separation of the mind and the body. You will see that the sensation and the
feeling are two separate things. The feeling sensation changes into a neutral
one. You are not attached to it and let it go in the present moment. You will
be left with three things: the physical sensation doing its thing, the mental
feeling doing its thing and the knowing, the consciousness, observing what
is going on. This is a Vipassana insight that we can break through to. Do it
only  on  meditation  pains!  If  this  happens,  you  should  make  a  note  in  the
present moment:
<em>Knowing, knowing, knowing</em>.
<em>A state of knowing is occur-</em>
<em>ring in the present and it is quite unique, a Vipassana insight knowing.</em>
Once
you have passed this stage, you may find that sitting will become easier and
easier for you. It only takes one or two breakthroughs like this to really break
through the false view that we have to be subjected to these sensations all
the time. We actually become to free the mind from physical sensations that
arise in the body. We become quite quick in it as well. So that we can get
to the point a physical painful sensation arises, and we quickly turn off the
mind so that we don’t have to react.</p>
