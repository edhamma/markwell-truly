<h2><span class="section-number">9.1. </span>Second enlightenment factor dhamma vicaya<a class="headerlink" href="#second-enlightenment-factor-dhamma-vicaya" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The second enlightenment factor is called
<em>dhamma vicaya</em>
or investigation of state. This is a part of wisdom. There is a simile: like being in a dark
room and you get a flashlight. Investigation is the wisdom factor that joins
with  the  consciousness,  with  the  knowing.  With  the  flashlight  we  start  to
see things in the room. Dhamma vicaya is the same. We activate our awareness in the present moment, allow mindfulness to penetrate the object, then
wisdom comes to play and knows what it is. This clear seeing enables the
letting go mechanism.</p>
<p>Mindfulness,  energy  and  investigation  spin  on  each  other.  Investigation takes up the role of wisdom.</p>
<p>A further four enlightenment factors start to arise when the conditions
are in place, that is the first three enlightenment factors are properly working
as a team, activating, noting, knowing, letting go, then we start to experience
other enlightenment factors. The next four rapture, tranquility, concentration
and equanimity start to arise in our practice.</p>
<p>Investigation  of  states  is  not  carried  out  by  the  means  of  the  thinking  process,  you  can’t  think  yourself  to  wisdom. Thinking  is  an  object  of
wisdom, an object of knowing. You can note it, know it and let it go. It is part
<span class="pdfpage">148</span>  of the field of conditioned phenomena that we are observing, noting, knowing and letting go. Thinking itself doesn’t lead intuitively to insights. It plays
a role in bringing us to some understanding, to the practice if you like. But
the investigation we are talking about is an intuitive discerning insight that
distinguishes the characteristic of the phenomena. And what are those phenomena? There is mind and body processes that we have been talking about
this week. When we see the dhamma, we see rupa, matter – earth, water, fire
and air and when we see nama, the mind, we see feelings, perceptions, intentions, attention and contact – vedanā, saññā, cetanā, manasikāra and phassa
is referred to as nama. So we are noting these physical and mental phenomena, we are seeing the individual characteristics of these things, the content
of these things, but we are not going into the content. We are much more
interested in noting the structure in which the content is operating. When we
do that we start to understand our insight. We start to understand the conditioning process that is happening in the mind and body unit. Sometimes
the body is the cause and the mind is the effect, sometimes the body is the
cause and the body is the effect, sometimes mind is the cause and mind is the
effect, or mind is the cause and body is the effect. Four ways. Actually, there
are many other ways the mind and the body are conditioning each other.</p>
<p>Mind,  matter,  cause  and  effect:  these  are  the  raw  data.  When  our
awareness and wisdom is able to note and know this continuously, we will
come to an even further understanding in our wisdom. We will move beyond
the content of our experience, the conceptualization of our experience, we
will move beyond the individual characteristics of each of these mental and
physical  phenomena.  We  will  go  into  another  mode  of  perception,  a  very
particular mode of perception. It is a Vipassana perception which allows us
to  see  all  mental  and  physical  phenomena  having  the  same  characteristic
of  impermanence,  unsatisfactoriness  –  dukkha  –  and  non-self.  This  is  the
insight,  that  dhamma  vicaya  presents  to  us  when  we  are  developing  this
enlightenment factor. It allows us to see not only the field of our experience
but we go beyond that. We see the characteristics of all phenomena, of all
conditioned phenomena. They are all impermanent, dukkha and non-self.</p>
<p>The  characteristic  of  investigation  is  just  to  know  and  see  things
clearly, not through intellectual investigation but through an intuitive mode
<span class="pdfpage">149</span>  of experience. You can’t make insights arise, you can’t force them to arise.
They only arise spontaneously when the conditions for them to arise are perfectly arranged: keeping the mind in the present moment, keeping the mind
stabilized, watching the objects as they arise and pass away, and then ‘bum’,
the  curtain  opens  and  insight  spontaneously  appears,  an  understanding,  a
knowledge comes into your mind and you know things. You see things very
differently. You come to an experience of the dhamma by yourself and for
yourself. You won’t need me to explain it to you, you will be independent
of other people’s explanations of what just happened. You will have seen for
yourself very clearly the nature of the body and the nature of the mind. You
will have known that these two things are two very separate and different
things. And  you  will  know  that  because  of  ignorance  and  unawareness  of
the present we don’t see things clearly. Because we don’t see things clearly,
we are caught in a habitual reaction mechanism of creating karma and then
being  exposed  to  the  resultants  which  just  keeps  looping  around. We  will
come to an understanding that this has been going on for a very long time.
We  will  understand  that  all  this  mental  and  physical  phenomena  doesn’t
belong  to  anybody  and  that  it  is  just  arising  and  passing  away.  We  come
about the insight of
<em>udayabbaya ñāṇa</em>
– the knowledge of arising and passing away. We see all phenomena arising and passing away, quite rapidly and
in a detached manner. We are not interfering with anything. Our awareness
and wisdom have been becoming quite sharp, quite consistent, quite continuous. We really even needn’t activate our awareness at this stage. We don’t
need to direct the mind anywhere. We don’t need to evaluate anything. The
mind stays still and holds itself in this mode of knowing, patiently observing and watching, witnessing the flow of physical and mental phenomena as
they bubble up and disappear. We come to an understanding of this Vipassana insight.</p>
<p>Now the function of investigation is to see things clearly. We come to
know this. The function is to totally remove this darkness from the mind so
that it remains illuminated and aware, so that it remains present. An enlightening  experience  is  a  continuous  arising  of  this  presence  in  the  moment
without  being  interested  to,  without  being  attracted  to  or  repelled  by  the
mental  and  physical  phenomena.  The  mind  becomes  completely  equanimous. <span class="pdfpage">150</span>  Detached, non-identifying with things that we used to take quite seriously, thoughts and emotional states that we would identify with and hold
to. You see that you can’t create an identity of that stuff you see. You know
it  is  not  you. This  is  the  function  of  insight,  that  we  let  things  go.  Greed,
hatred,  delusion,  the  hindrances.  We  can  free  our  consciousness  from  the
subjectivation  process  and  can  live  in  a  state  of  peace  and  freedom.  Free
from attachment and clinging.</p>
<p>The manifestation of investigation is the dissipation of confusion. There
is no longer doubt about what the nature of the body and mind is. We don’t
rely on other people telling us what the body and mind is. We have seen it for
ourselves. The dhamma, six qualities, discernible by the wise, to be seen for
oneself, dhamma leads one on. When we have seen it, all becomes dustness,
this is how it is rolling through, this is how the karma is rolling out. And
we become content with that. This is what is happening today. Don’t worry
about  yesterday,  don’t  think  about  tomorrow.  This  is  our  present  moment
experience. Try to make yourself alert and awake, each morning you wake
up, observe. This is a new day. Let’s see what the karma will bring. Is there
going to be pleasantness or is there going to be unpleasantness? Either way
we note, know and let go of it. We don’t get caught up. We enjoy it for what
it is without attachment, and then it’s gone. When it’s gone we are not upset,
because  we  understand  that  that  is  its  nature.  Its  nature  is  to  pass  away.
When we don’t embrace the characteristics of conditioned phenomena, we
can save ourselves of a lot of dukkha. Of course it’s gone! That’s its nature.
Don’t  hold  on  so  tightly  that  when  it’s  gone  you  experience  dukkha.  It  is
only the holding that gives us dukkha. It’s just mental and physical phenomena, just doing its thing. Consciousness is knowing it, that is all.</p>
<p>Matter is made up of the four elements. We know that they have their
individual characteristics. We experience these characteristics and can sink
into them by noting and knowing continuously and let go of them. Then we
might break through and have a vision of the ultimate reality of the four elements, a vision of what this physical body is. It’s not what you think it is, but
that’s up to you to examine for yourself.</p>
<p>When we bring our attention to the rise and fall of the abdomen, it is
composed of sensations. Try to let go of the conceptual image of the body.
<span class="pdfpage">151</span>  We have had an image of our body in our minds all our lives. We have a look
at it. Don’t do your meditation on the abdomen seeing moving a body part.
It is a field of sensations. That is what it is! We need to move beyond our
concepts of stomach, rising, abdomen, falling. We need to go into the mode
of perceptions where we are just perceiving physical sensations. Tightness,
the pushing, the hardness, the softness, the warmth, the flow, the vibration,
tingling, all these physical sensations that are arising there. That is what we
want to slide into, if you like.</p>
<p>When  we  see  this  in  the  rising  and  falling  process,  two  distinct  processes are going on: it is the physical phenomena of the tension, of the pushing, of the pulling, movement of the abdomen and there is also consciousness, the knowing is there as well. These are two different processes. Both
of them are arising and passing away.
<em>Consciousness is not a stable thing</em>
<em>either!</em>
It  arises  when  its  conditions  are  in  place  –  internal  base,  external
base, meeting together, consciousness arises – and then it cognizes the experience and passes away as well. The whole thing has no solidity in it at all.
All is completely unstable, all is completely out of control. It’s impersonal.
Consciousness arising, mind and matter arising, they have a symbiotic relationship,  they  cause  each  other,  they  lean  upon  each  other.  Without  consciousness  nama-rupa  cannot  be  known.  It  doesn’t  have  a  space  to  arise.
Without nama-rupa consciousness doesn’t have a condition upon which to
arise. So the two are mutually conditioning each other. The whole thing is
arising and passing away the whole time.</p>
<p>So if you realize this for you, your mind is balanced and you experience equanimity. Things are arising and passing away. The first insight can
be illuminating but also shocking, you may feel foolished, tricked about the
thing sitting on the mat. What is so appealing of the body, head hair, body
hair, nails, teeth, skin, eyes? What is so attractive? Maybe the nails, but only
when they are painted not when they are in the soup. The hair on the floor is
no more me, mine, I. Have a look at the nature of the body! What is it really
that  we  are  attaching  to? These  things  are  completely  out  of  control. You
can’t say I wish my hair has a different color. The nails are just growing, we
can’t stop them, out of control! The heart pumps blood through our system.
The body takes care of itself, air is coming in and out. Sounds are operating,
<span class="pdfpage">152</span>  sights are going on. Your teeth are decaying. It is all happening by itself. It’s
not happening to anyone and it’s not happening to you. No one is controlling
it, and it is not under the control of an external power. There is nobody sitting on the clouds, looking down and controlling things. It’s out of control.
It is going on according to its own cause and effect mechanism.</p>
<p>And this is the mechanism that the Buddha discovered. He didn’t invent
the teaching, he uncovered the truth. He uncovered how things are actually
operating and then disclosed that to the world. The world has been listening
to it, practicing it and realizing it for 2500 years. That’s what the Buddha
is, the one who knows. Somebody who broke through and had the ability to
transmit the knowledge what the body-mind process is. Seeing it so clearly
giving us a formula of the dependent origination so that we also can come
to the understanding of the nature of the reality and remove this craving for
being.
<em>Baba niroda nirvana</em>
– the cessation of being is nirvana. When that
being, that wish to be someone, that desire, that craving to become, to get, to
achieve, when that is completely let go of, that is what the Buddha is teaching is nirvana. It is the removal of the sense of self from your experience,
from the experience of the mind and body process. It goes back completely
to full nature, it goes back to dhamma. The consciousness has become freed
no  longer  finding  a  foundation  on  which  it  can  establish  a  sense  of  self.
All foundations have been covered by mindfulness. The four foundations of
mindfulness have been used correctly to establish awareness and wisdom in
the present moment. All holes have been blocked, we are holding back the
tide of the sense of self. We freed the mind, we become very light, no stress,
no worrying, thinking about future plans because there is no-one it’s going
to happen to. Future is just a thought arising in the present. We don’t have
to worry about it. Just wake up every morning and be glorious. We have no
other work to do than to activate our awareness and wisdom in the present
moment. Nothing else really makes sense once you have seen the nature of
the mind and the body. We can go on and perform various tasks and do different things, eventually we just have to go back and do our spiritual work,
because the rest of it, what for? Unless you have a philosophy like a good
friend of mine. The meaning of life according to him is, that the one with the
most toys wins.</p>
<p><span class="pdfpage">153</span>  Spontaneous insight causes insight to happen. Insight begets insight.
Once  we  start  to  see  things,  we  start  to  practice  more,  we  start  to  put  the
conditions  in  place  even  more  effectively.  Further  insights  start  to  unfold.
We activate our awareness repeatedly, not judging, not getting upset by what
we find by activating that awareness, whatever mind state is lurking in the
dark,  wherever  our  mind  has  wandered  to,  whatever  emotional  cloud  has
descended upon us, we don’t judge it, we don’t get upset, we don’t push it
away. Wisdom is that which allows it just to be there. We accept whatever
is there. When we accept it, then we let it go. We let go of things through
accepting them. We don’t let go of things through pushing them away. When
we accept how things are, then we become content toward that experience. It
is what it is. We see it clearly. If there is something that has become unpleasant, we don’t get upset. We activate our awareness, switch on our wisdom,
see  that  object  clearly,  the  mind  disengages  and  steps  back  from  it,  stops
identifying with it, knows it as a dependently arisen, conditioned phenomena
subject to the three characteristics of impermanence, dukkha and non-self,
and that object passes away. It’s seen. It can no longer be a base for me and
mine. It’s purpose has been foiled. It doesn’t have an effect on our experience.  It’s  just  stuff  lofting  by,  just  like  clouds  floating  through  the  sky.  It
just passes through. Mental and physical phenomena start to arise and pass
away. Arise and pass away. Arise and pass away. Nothing is sticky. We don’t
get caught in the story of any of the mind states or any of the thoughts. We
become like teflon. We don’t attach to anything. And the dukkha just evaporates. It just disappears. We start to see things as they really are.</p>
<p>This second enlightenment factor is very important. We have been calling it wisdom. The first enlightenment factor we have been calling awareness.
<em>Awareness and wisdom and energy.</em>
These three are the workers activating  noting,  knowing,  letting  go,  activating  noting,  knowing,  letting  go
–  pulling  us  into  the  present  moment,  penetrating  the  object,  disengaging
from it and watching it pass away. We can do this over and over. If we can
stabilize this activity, if we can still the mind and still keep doing this meditation practice, then our samadhi starts to increase. Samadhi with awareness
and wisdom. Not the kind of samadhi with concentration that falls down a
well on the ground, kind of pleasant but dull not really knowing anything.
<span class="pdfpage">154</span>  Awareness and wisdom with concentration, this is how our insights start to
arise. This is how we start to let go of the defilements, of the cravings, of the
aversions, of the frustrations and annoyances – all those types of mind states.</p>

<section id="intention">
<h2><span class="section-number">9.2. </span>Intention<a class="headerlink" href="#intention" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>I also want to talk about intention, particularly in our walking meditation practice we are going to introduce that aspect of intention. Intention to
act or to do something implies a forethought. We think before we act. First
there is a mental action before the physical or before we speak. Structurally
there must always be an intention before a physical or verbal action takes
place. Before we do anything, we must instruct the body to move, to twist,
to open, to close, to look. Before any of these physical actions, there must
be a thought or order and that thought we call
<em>cetana</em>. The Buddha said,
<em>«I</em>
<em>declare to you that cetana is karma.»</em></p>
<p>The  mind  really  does  cause  matter.  If  you  think  you  want  to  raise
your hand, you think, «raise your hand». It is through thinking that it happens. The mind animates this meat-puppet. The nature of the body is kind
of dumb. It is just the elements, the same elements as outside, the external
elements  are  the  same  as  the  internal  four  elements.  But  when  consciousness has left the body, it just lies on the floor like a rotten log. We call that
dead. Even when people are unconscious they are like dead. Consciousness
animates the body.
<em>It opens its mannerisms</em>, all manifestations of the mind
states. If we become upset, the eyes start crying, we start to shake, our heart
starts to pump a little stronger, breath becomes shorter. The mind affects how
the body is operating.</p>
<p>In our walking meditation, we are going to expand our awareness to
include  awareness  of  intention  of  the  four  stages  in  the  walking.  So  you
should pay attention to the moment just before you lift the foot, before you
raise the foot, before you move the foot and before you place the foot. This
intention will be difficult for you to see in the beginning stages. So we make
a little thought, it is a little contrived but effective. ‘Intending to lift – lifting,
intending to raise – raising, intending to move – moving, intending to place –
placing’. Before each of these stages you should become aware of the desire
to move your foot. Become aware of your mental thought to move your foot.
<span class="pdfpage">155</span>  We are paying attention to the thought before we lift and then the lifting. The
intention to lift the foot is nama, mind. Moving the foot is rupa, matter. So
the intention and the movement are mind and matter, arising simultaneously.
They arise together and cease together. If you can drop your mind into the
present moment by continuously noting this action, independent of desire,
independent of any wanting to see anything or for any kind of experience, if
you can drop into it, you can have an experience of mind and matter in the
present moment. And you will be able to see things as they really are. And
you  will  also  be  able  to  see  the  conditioning  process  that  occurs  between
mind and matter. You will see that the mind is actually conditioning the body
in this circumstance. Later on we will see all kinds of conditioning patterns.
Intention  is  difficult  to  note  at  first  if  the  mind  is  not  continuously
aware of the present moment. It takes effort to maintain our awareness continuously.</p>
<p>Keep your mind in the moving foot. Lower your head, keep your eyes
three quarters closed. Don’t become distracted by the jungle or other people’s body. Begin your walking meditation practice at a little bit faster pace,
so that you can build up some rhythm. Then after 5 or 10 minutes slow down
to the super-slow walking if you wish to. You should build up momentum
and get used to your walking path. Center yourself in the practice that you’re
doing and then start to slow down. If you’re having difficulty with the walking meditation, try walking on a solid floor. A stone floor or tiles will make
it easier. The best way is to walk closely to your sitting mat so that you have
no  breaks  in  between  the  walking  and  sitting.  So  you  stand-up,  you  walk
and  then  you  sit  down  again  immediately.  No  gaps,  no  breaks.  Really  try
to tighten up those gaps or breaks that you may have given yourself during
the walking and sitting meditation. Try to take that hour and a half period
as one continuous time zone of awareness in the present moment regardless
of whether you’re walking or sitting or transitioning between the two. Try to
keep it together.</p>
<p>The systematic practice of this four stage walking meditation will lead
us to seeing the nature of
<em>sabhava</em>
or
<em>ultimate reality, intrinsic reality of mind</em>
<em>and matter</em>. We will be able to see that intention actually moves the body.
You will see this for yourself. So note the consciousness consisting of the
<span class="pdfpage">156</span>  intentions. You can do this in other practices as well not only the walking but
in the sitting or do it in the dining hall when you are intending to reach for
the cup of coffee or something. ‘Intending to reach, intending’, then reach
out, when you touch the cup, ‘hardness, hardness’, when intending to bend
your  arm,  ‘intending  to  bend,  intending  to  bend,  bending,  bending’,  then
you’re bending it up, ’intending to flip the head back’, we flip it back and
pour it in, pour the coffee in our face. We are tasting. Tasting is occurring.</p>
<p>Be aware of the intentions before you start to make your movements.
Opening the door to the dorm room, go through the whole sequence. Going
to the bathroom. Brushing your teeth – be mindful when moving the brush
up, ‘up’ or down, ‘down’ instead of moving it in your face and thinking of
all other things.</p>
<p>So the inclusion of intention can slow things down but be very fascinating. You may start to feel walking like a robot. You may feel all kinds of
different energies flowing through the body. The four elements will start to
get clearer as well.</p>
<p>But most of all you start to see the cause and effect of things and that is
the most important. We want to see ourselves that actually these mind states
are causing the body to move. These states not only cause the body to move
but can cause all other kinds of effects on the body as well. Some of you
might be familiar with the term psycho-somatic. Diseases that are caused in
the body by the mind. Through repeatedly thinking in one way, we can actually make the body sick. The mind has a very powerful effect over the body.
Start to see this connection.</p>
<p>We  can  witness  the  power  that  the  mind  has  in  the  walking  process.
If  we  just  observe  the  simple  things  in  our  live,  such  as  walking,  we  can
come to a profound understanding that intention has power over the body.
Intention makes the body walk around, it can make it sit down, it can make
it stand up. Intention makes it do and say all the things it does. When we
start to realize the power intention has over the body, you start to think that
you better take care over these mind states that you are generating in your
mind.  Mind  states  do  actually  have  power.  There  is  a  karmic  energy  produced as well through intention. Not only does intention affect the body in
the present moment but it creates karmic energy that remains latent waiting
<span class="pdfpage">157</span>  for  an  opportunity  to  manifest. Waiting  for  the  conditions  to  be  right  that
that karma can give its fruit. We have to be careful of what kind of intentions
we are making because it is generating both wholesome and unwholesome
karma. We have to be aware that we are actually conditioning our existence
through our intentional structure. We are creating our world, we create the
world that we live in through our thoughts. We are all responsible for our
own thoughts and the world we live in. Our experience on a day to day basis
is  the  result  of  our  karma. We  are  born  of  our  karma,  heirs  of  our  karma,
related to each other through our karma. Whatever we do for good or bad
that we will forebear. Everything that is going on in the mind and body process is karma related. We are either creating karma or we are observing the
results of old karma. This is a natural process, it doesn’t require anyone to
do anything, either internal or external agents. It is like gravity. It doesn’t
need to be anyone there to turn on the gravity switch. It is just like that. It is
a natural law. It is a physical law. So karma is a mental law. It is just like that.
That is what the Buddha discovered. That is how he uncovered the nature of
the mind and body process.</p>
<p>So  in  our  walking  mediation  we  sharpen  up  our  processes.  We  consciously  generate  the  thought  lifting  before  lifting. Think,  «I  am  going  to
lift the foot now», and then lift it. «I am going to move it», and then move
it. «I am going to place it», then place it. We can say these words to ourselves, it it’s helpful, we don’t need to. ‘Going to lift, lifting, going to move,
moving,  going  to  place,  placing’. Then  move  your  awareness  to  the  other
foot. Always keep your awareness in the moving foot. It is really important
that it is on the sole of the foot, following the physical sensation. Try to bring
this intention and the movement closer and closer together. See how they are
influencing each other. Actually they are happening at the same time in real
time. In the beginning of our practice, when we are generating a thought or
intention to lift or move or place, then there will be some succession. First
we think, then we move. As you get used to doing it – keep going around
and around and around – you start to find that the intention and the movement start to correlate with each other. And you start to think that it moves,
it moves automatically. You start to see that the physical body is animated, it
starts to move because of intention. We can witness this for ourselves in the
<span class="pdfpage">158</span>  walking meditation practice.</p>
<p>So try to see very clearly the different stages in the walking meditation.
Don’t mix them up. They are four individual discreet events. Lifting, raising, moving, placing. When we keep a gap for each stage, we see that each
stage arises and passes away. And when that has happened, it is finished, we
can move on to the next event. The next stage, it’s finished. The next stage,
it’s  finished.  Finished,  finished,  finished.  We  start  to  see  that  these  stages
in the walking meditation are very impermanent. They arise and pass away
quite rapidly even when we are walking slowly. They arise and pass, arise
and pass. You should take a great deal of care in observing, be meticulous.
Don’t think that the walking meditation is secondary to the sitting meditation.  Bring  the  energy,  the  mindfulness  and  the  wisdom  developed  in  that
walking meditation into the meditation hall. Use it in your sitting meditation.
Don’t waste it by wandering here and there after the walking meditation.</p>
<p>The realization of this cause and effect mechanism can be witnessed
for ourselves in the present moment.</p>
<p>Don’t give in in any thoughts or emotions during the walking meditation.  Cut  it,  bring  it  back  into  the  present.  But  don’t  walk  wanting  results
to occur. That will cause a lot of frustration. It ends always in tears. In the
back of our mind there is some craving, we want to become a mediator, getting results. We must check our attitude.
<em>We are not walking to get results,</em>
<em>but  to  put  the  conditions  in  place.</em>
We  follow  the  instructions,  don’t  leave
anything away. Follow them as closely as you can. If you notice wishing,
imagine results, the mind expanding to the universe and generating all kinds
of knowledge, then we only generated ideas. Let go of these! Put aside all
theories and just do the practice in the present moment. That is the only way
how you will truly understand the nature of the mind and body process.</p>
<p>A deep insight is an intuitive expression of the mind revealing the reality  of  nature  in  the  present  moment  to  us.  When  you  least  expect  it,  the
dhamma presents itself to us. The only thing you need to do is to get out of
the way – literally, you. The only reason why Vipassana is not arising is that
we may have expectations or a desire for something to arise. Drop all your
expectations  and  wishes  for  success  and  achievements.  Meditation  is  the
complete opposite of achievement, it is letting go of everything that we have
<span class="pdfpage">159</span>  ever learned in school. We are not here to achieve anything, we are here to
relinquish and let go of everything.</p>
