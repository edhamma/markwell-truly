<p>Day  three  is  sometimes  characterized  as  being  a  difficult  day.  But  I
often feel that the first and second days are more difficult myself. You will be
feeling very tired. You will be feeling quite exhausted. Don’t start following
your thoughts or getting trapped in your thinking, in your own whispering
mind. Of course it’s challenging. Everyone is facing their own challenges. It
won’t be long before you can pull yourself out of these mind state. It’s what
we are here for. We are training to pull ourself out of difficult mind states
such as stress, worry, anguish. We are learning how to come out of it. If we
never  learn  how  to  come  out  of  that  through  meditation,  then  you  always
come out of your mind states using something else. Wether it be some kind
of sensuality or some kind of distraction, some kind of technology or whatever it may be. So why not use our own mind, our awareness and wisdom to
pull us out of these mind states?</p>
<p>This  morning  we  are  going  to  talk  about  the  five  hindrances  or  the
<em>panca  nivarana</em>.  These  are  mind  states  which  are  contained  in  the  fourth
section  of  the  satipatthana  text,  in  the  section  called
<em>dhamma-nupassana</em>
or  recollection  of  mind  objects. These  are  thought  processes  that  are  arising  and  passing  away.  The  Buddha  asked  us  to  observe  them,  to  become
aware of them, to fully understand them. To say these five hindrances are an
impediment to our meditation would be an understatement. They do disturb
<span class="pdfpage">114</span>  our practice. They make it difficult to do the mediation practice, however,
these mental states are also an important vehicle for insight. You can learn a
lot about the nature of the mind through observing your reactions and your
thought patterns to things.</p>
<p>We can temporarily overcome these hindrances in our meditation practice, but they are only fully removed at the noble eightfold path. When we
reach  the  level  of  stream  entry,  some  of  the  hindrances  will  be  cut  off,  in
particular doubt will be cut off.</p>
<p>Turning our attention to these hindrances at the time of a meditation
retreat can sometimes be a little bit late. These hindrances are always arising in our mind. They’re always there. In fact, they are much of our mental
life which is spent floating around in those hindrances. It’s because of these
hindrances that our mind does not become concentrated at deeper levels of
samadhi.  Because  these  hindrances  are  always  getting  in  our  way,  they’re
always blocking us, always disturbing our meditation development.</p>
<p>So what we will be doing here is identifying these mental states. You
will all be experiencing one or two of the hindrances or unfortunately maybe
five of the hindrances. Listen to them and see if you can identify these mental
states going on and see if they’re causing you any problem.
<em>We just need to
note them, know and let them go! The same technique is prescribed to the</em>
<em>mental objects and to mental states.</em>
They are constantly with us, these five
hindrances. The five hindrances are constantly coming to disturb us.</p>
<p>The five hindrances are legitimate objects of our satipatthana practice.
They are presently arising, they are dependently arisen, conditioned and they
are impermanent and they are unsatisfactory and they are impersonal. They
don’t belong to anyone. So see if you can notice these defilements. These
five hindrances are types of defilements, types of imperfections of the mind
that  come  to  cloud  the  mind  in  their  own  way  so  that  the  mind  can’t  see
things clearly. They kind of get in the way by the five hindrances attacking
the mind.</p>
<p>So in our meditation practice we need to keep alert, be aware. If you
find  that  you  are  being  attacked  by  one  of  these  five  hindrances,  you  will
need to address the problem. You will need to have a close look at it, make
a note of which hindrance is occurring and try to step away from it. Try to
<span class="pdfpage">115</span>  disconnect or disengage from the mental state. It will still be there, it may
have some unpleasantness or it may have some pleasantness associated with
it. Try to step away, stop engaging with that particular state. Watch it pass
away. Watch it dissolve under the light of awareness and wisdom.</p>
<p>There’s a wonderful quote the Buddha gives us.
<em>«Whatever a bikkhu
frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his</em>
<em>mind.»</em>
Whatever we think about, in the way we are thinking whilst we are
thinking, we are actually conditioning our own mind until we become that
person! If we are constantly getting frustrated and agitated, constantly developing little states of aversion all the time, then chances are we are developing that and that we turn into that person. We are going to turn into an angry
person! We’re  going  to  turn  into  a  person  with  a  lot  of  issues  about  other
people or other things. So be aware of this tendency, be aware of this conditioning process. Whatever you frequently think and ponder upon, that will
become the inclination of your mind. So be very careful!</p>
<p>If you constantly worry about things, you are conditioning your mind
to be in a state of fear and then you become that person. You start to live that
reality because you have been conditioning your mind. Frequently thinking
and pondering upon. Every moment you’re conditioning. So be very careful
with what kind of thoughts you start to condition the mind with, because that
is what you end up as. That is the reality you start to live.</p>
<p>If you noticed that you have come under the sway of a hindrance, don’t
feed  it  with  any  more  thoughts  about  it.  We  are  not  here  to  continuously
think  about  things.  Thinking  is  not  meditation.  Thinking  feeds  the  mind
states. Just like the dog that comes to visit your house. If you feed it, it is
likely to come back the next day. If you feed it again, it will come back and
end up sleeping on your couch. That’s what happens when we start to feed
things. They come back and they become part of the furniture. They become
part of our experience of life. So be careful with these five hindrances.</p>
<p><em>These are the five things you need to let go in order to enter jhana, to</em>
<em>enter the states of samadhi, necessary for unfolding insight.</em>
You will need
to  remove  these.  We  don’t  try  and  push  them  away.  This  is  important  to
remember. We are not trying to push away anything or get rid of anything.
We are not trying to get anything, or to become anything. We are checking
<span class="pdfpage">116</span>  our attitude in how we are meditating and we are just observing whatever is
there. We are just accepting that it is there. We may not like it, but we accept
it as this present moment experience contained with this. That’s what’s there.
You accept it for what it is. You note it’s there, you disengage from it, step
back from it and just let it go. It drops by itself as soon as you’ve disengaged
from it.</p>
<p>These five hindrances are very habitual states of mind. They are constantly  coming  back  and  we  are  constantly  reacting  in  the  same  way  to
things. It becomes a habit. We start to condition ourselves with things. If you
don’t like tomato sauce, you start to condition yourself and will never like
it. As far as our mind is concerned we are just reacting. We’ve developed a
pattern of disliking. Whenever we see a bottle of tomato sauce, we avoid it.
If someone puts tomato sauce on our food, we become upset, because we
don’t like it. We haven’t been eating tomato sauce for 10 years and still react
in the same way. There is some disliking there because we have conditioned
the mind. We have done this in many, many ways throughout our lives. We
have developed little habits, tendencies. So we need to have a look at these.
We need to see the suffering that these tendencies have caused us and then
we will be able to let them go, to be able to break the cycle of reaction. We
don’t have to be reacting machines. We can be alert and aware in the present
moment, allowing whatever it is to arise noting it, knowing it and letting it
go.</p>
<section id="first-hindrance-kamacchanda">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.1. </span>First hindrance kāmacchanda<a class="headerlink" href="#first-hindrance-kamacchanda" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>So the first hindrance is known as
<em>kāmacchanda</em>
or sensual desire. It
means desiring things of the sense doors, wanting sensual pleasures, wanting pleasurable objects that arise through the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body
doors. It is a state of mind of wanting, seeking, wanting to get something,
wanting to change something. When you’re wanting things. When the mind
goes off desiring, yearning, a strong desire to get a higher education degree
or a strong desire to try and buy an expensive house or get a fancy car or
whatever it may be. Have a look if your mind is inclining towards this. «Oh I
like that yoga mat, oh that is a nice top I want to get», whatever it is that you
start looking at and start liking and wanting. It is amazing how the mind will
<span class="pdfpage">117</span>  find something even in the barren environment to start liking, to start wanting. We are looking at the tendency. Not so much the objects. We want to
know if the mind energy of sensual desire is there. We want to see if there is
any inclination of the mind wanting to go out and enjoy sensuality. Passion.
Lusting. Maybe you have spotted someone on the retreat and had a look at
their body having lustful thoughts. Or you’re thinking about when lunch is
going to be. There can be many other different things that we crave for, that
we wish for. So have a look at this kind of coveting mind.</p>
<p>Especially  for  beautiful  things.  We  hope  and  desire  and  want  things
which are beautiful. We think they will make us happy in some way. Desirous, we work hard to get the things that we think are beautiful.</p>
<p>Sometimes  we  are  just  after  refinements  in  sensuality.  You  have  a
cotton  shirt  and  want  to  get  a  silk  shirt.  You  want  other  flip-flops.  Other
sunglasses, thinking of upgrading, to get things better. Maybe you are thinking  of  upgrading  your  boyfriend  or  maybe  of  upgrading  to  a  new  kind  of
relationship. You’re trying to get things better. This kind of energy that flows
through the mind of wanting. It’s reaching out to things and desiring them.
This is a hindrance that comes to play in our meditation practice. When we
sit  and  meditate  and  it  starts  to  want  something.  Maybe  it’s  something  at
home, maybe some kind of recognition, maybe it wants some power, or it
wants to be somebody famous. It wants to be something.</p>
<p>Looking  for  nice  food  when  getting  out  of  here,  wanting  to  go  to  a
party, dancing, fun activities. That’s fine but just have a look at that craving,
wanting energy. We normally go for these kind of objects when we are experiencing dukkha, when there is some unpleasantness in our life. When we are
maybe not too comfortable in a dorm room, when we have been sitting on
the floor for many hours, when we are extremely tired or frustrated. Perhaps
the sound of my voice starts to annoy you thinking this is unbearable for you.
Whatever it is that you’re kind of finding that you want to change. You’re
wanting something to be different. Look at that! There is nothing wrong here
but there may be some resistance in your mind.</p>
<p>You  may  be  missing  the  normal  objects  that  you  delight  yourself.
Maybe  you’re  used  to  having  an  evening  beer  and  a  joint.  Maybe  you’re
missing  your  partner,  your  lover.  Maybe  you  want  to  have  certain  food,  a
<span class="pdfpage">118</span>  certain  environment.  Maybe  you  are  missing  a  comfortable  bed.  «I  want
air-con.» These are simple things that we start to think about, but they come
to disturb our meditation. Particularly if we start looping and thinking about
them again and again. Be careful because you start to condition the mind.</p>
<p>The  Buddha  gives  us  a  simile  of  dyed  water.  The  water  is  normally
crystal-clear but the water has become all colored and we cannot see through
the water too clearly. This is what the mind with sensual desire is like. The
normal state of the mind without the five hindrances is bright and clear. It
knows things. It sees things quite clearly. Because of these hindrances it has
become clouded with color so that we can’t see into it. We can’t see things as
they really are. We are seeing our projections and our conceptualizations that
we paint on top of everything.</p>
<p>So  we’re  bringing  ourselves  into  the  present  moment,  activate  our
awareness, become aware of this sensual desire in our mind. Try not to get
caught up in the story of the sensual desire. That means don’t think about the
objects of your sensual desire – pizza, girls, going on a diving trip, whatever it is that you’re wanting. You can be sure that everyone will have some
sensual desire, something we can enjoy through the eye, ear, nose, tongue
or  the  body  doors. This  is  very  much  how  we  spend  our  time  here  in  the
human realm. Most of our time we spend chasing something delightful that
we  can  enjoy. We  want  things.  Have  a  look  at  that. When  you  notice  that
there is any desiring of something, make a note ‚desiring, desiring, wanting,
wanting, lusting, lusting,…’ nothing is too small to note. No thought that is
arising is too small, too insignificant to note. We need to note continuously
because  what  is  happening  is  the  mind  is  going  into  the  objects,  and  then
we note, and we’re coming out of it. We go in and then we come out. We go
in and then we come out. This is because our awareness and wisdom is not
continuous enough yet. So we can note something, then we wander a little
bit, note something and wander again a little bit. We want to get to the stage
where we can hold back the whole flood of objects coming in through the
six sense doors with our awareness and our wisdom so that we don’t go out
of our meditation practice. So that we can create a void area, a demilitarized
zone, if you like around all these mind objects. So we can stay back and not
let them touch us or disturb us in any way.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">7.2. </span>Second hindrance vyāpāda<a class="headerlink" href="#second-hindrance-vyapada" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><span class="pdfpage">119</span> The second hindrance is known as
<em>vyāpāda</em>. It means ill will or aversion. This is the mind state which does not like stuff. The opposite of the first
one. It is always trying to get rid of something. This is the type of mental
reaction if we don’t like something. We develop some kind of aversion or
anger it can escalate to, states of irritation, where the mind becomes annoyed
with something, maybe it’s some kind of frustration state. Once it arises, if
we  don’t  note  it  and  know  it,  it’s  going  to  start  looping,  it’s  going  to  start
turning around again and again, irritating us, getting us more upset, getting
us more unmindful and then going into it again, thinking about it again, not
wanting this, anything but this. To get out of here. These kind of mind states
start to arise.</p>
<p>We start judging, comparing, complaining, resisting things. We want to
push them away. We don’t like it. Look at this type of energy, this frustration
or  annoyance  or  aversion  or  judgment.  Maybe  you’re  judging  others.  Out
there on the walking path, you’re looking at other people, judging: «Oh, they
are not walking very fast. Walking too fast. They’re being slack. They’re not
sitting. Oh, they’re leaning against a wall. Oh, she’s sitting very straight.»
Maybe  you’re  judging  people  like  that. You  start  comparing  yourself  with
others.</p>
<p>Maybe  you  have  some  unfulfilled  expectations.  Maybe  you  thought
you’re  going  to  come  here,  sitting  nice  and  peaceful,  with  candles  and
incense, with Spa music in the background. No, your expectations have not
been fulfilled!</p>
<p>Maybe you started blaming others: «I can’t meditate because that girl
is always coughing. I can’t do the walking meditation, because that guy is
moving his arms around all time. I can’t get any sleep because lizards are in
my room.» Maybe you start to blame the whole world for all your troubles
here.
<em>There’s  nothing  wrong  with  the  world!  There  may  be  some  issues  in</em>
<em>your mind</em>. So have a look at this stuff as it starts to bubble up.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be funny to have a look at the mind. Again and again
to see how ridiculous our reactions are. We find it amusing if we can pull
ourselves out it. If we can’t pull ourselves out of it, we start looping, we start
to cause ourselves a lot of dukkha.</p>
<p><span class="pdfpage">120</span>  Have a look at that pushing away energy. Have a look at the mind, the
image of your reaction. That’s all it’s doing. It’s reacting to things. It’s like a
two year old. It’s not getting what it wants. «I want it to be otherwise. I don’t
wanted to be like this. I want to be like that.» See how you’re reacting. If
you are reacting like that and identifying with those mind states, is it causing happiness or suffering? Can you feel the suffering flowing through your
veins of the body? Can you feel being upset with it? If you don’t deal with it
here, where are you going to deal with it? It’s just going to keep coming up.
You’re going to keep reacting in the same way until you set yourself up to
be a constant reactor. Maybe a nuclear reactor if you get upset about people.
There are some explosions awaiting to happen.</p>
<p>Maybe you are comparing. Some people have been to different meditation retreats, done a few different techniques and they’ve started to compare.
«On  this  retreat  we  were  allowed  to  do  that.  Here  we’re  not  allowed  to.»
You start to get aversion toward something. Comparing, judging. «This one
is better for me. The food is really good here but the silence is really good
there.»</p>
<p>So have a look at the complaining or criticizing mind. Your reflections
or your criticism of things that are going on, are just a reflection of your own
mind. It’s just displaying how you are reacting in the world. When we are
here in silence, it’s a very good chance to see what we are. It’s a very good
chance to see how our mind reacts and to see how we can handle how our
mind reacts to things.
<em>You’re going to have to come to terms with your mental
states at some time. You have to watch them.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are not aware of them or don’t know how to deal with them, you</em>
<em>will be constantly in trouble.</em>
Constantly causing yourself stress. You are a
‘the grass is always greener over there’-person. Constantly shuffling. «It’s
not good enough here, I have to go over there.»</p>
<p>Sometimes people run around looking for enlightenment. They think
happiness is going to be outside somewhere. Maybe in a particular ashram in
the Himalaya, maybe on a beach in South America. But that is not how it is.
These things are happening in the mind.
<em>Our problems are in the mind.</em>
Happiness is right here and dukkha is right here as well – right here in this very
body!
<em>«In this fathom length body is dukkha, the arising of dukkha, the ces-</em>
<em>sation of dukkha and the path leading to the cessation do dukkha.»</em>
<span class="pdfpage">121</span>   We don’t
need to look outside anywhere for our supreme happiness. It is right here!</p>
<p>External  stuff  is  just  a  distraction  for  us.  It’s  just  sensuality.  Just  to
kind of keep us going so the whole world doesn’t implode in some enormous
dukkha state. If we didn’t have any sensuality, imagine what an existence we
would be living in. If we didn’t have awareness and wisdom and couldn’t
engage in sensuality, then our life would become a never-ending nightmare.
– So start to have a look at this. Start to have a look at your mind state.</p>
<p>See  if  you  are  pushing  something  away,  if  you’re  not  satisfied  with
something. Have a look at the dissatisfied mind. Sometimes it can lead to
hatred, sometimes it can lead to anger, sometimes it can even lead to thoughts
of violence. «If that guy bangs that dorm room door one more time….». You
start to have thoughts like that.</p>
<p>So make a note that your mind starts judging, starts comparing, starts
complaining, having negative experiences towards things. Take note of that.
Step out of that looping mind state. Free yourself from it. Just make a little
bit of effort, ‘comparing, judging, judging, dissatisfied, dissatisfied’ and step
back from that.</p>
<p>Who is it who is dissatisfied? Who is complaining here? What’s going
on? There is a mental state that is bouncing around inside your head. And
you are identifying with it. Holding it, claiming it to be you. That of course
causes you dukkha. If you can stop identifying with it, then it stops bouncing
around. It disappears.</p>
<p>It only stays, if we’re identifying with it. Objects remain in the present, if we identify with them. When we don’t identify, they pass! They pass
very quickly and they’re gone. And they come back again, and they are gone.
Come back again, gone again. This is the power of awareness and wisdom.
So try not to get stuck or caught in the story of your own aversions, of your
own dissatisfactions, of your judgments.</p>
<p>The Buddha said, that this type of mind state, is like boiling water. You
can’t see into the water. It’s boiling, it’s bubbling. So we need to turn off the
gas. Allow the water to calm down and then we will be able to see into this
particular mind state.</p>

<section id="third-hindrance-thinamiddha">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.3. </span>Third hindrance thīnamiddha<a class="headerlink" href="#third-hindrance-thinamiddha" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><span class="pdfpage">122</span>  The  third  hindrance,  that  we  all  have  been  experiencing,  is  called
<em>thīnamiddha</em>.  It  is  normally  translated  as  sloth  and  torpor,  but  because
nobody knows what that means, we translate it as laziness and boredom.</p>
<p>This is the kind of mind state which comes to infect us, when we start
to become «uuhf», lazy. We start to become bored of things. We can’t raise
enough energy even to lift our head up. Our body is slump.</p>
<p>In sitting meditation, you think, «I’ll just sit here and pretend», waiting
for the bell, waiting for lunchtime. Maybe the head’s on the wall. You started
nodding away. Sleeping. Have a look if you have been infected by this kind
of laziness energy.</p>
<p>It can be quite troubling. It starts as tiredness and then you start thinking about being tired. You start to feed it. You need to note it clearly, «oh,
there is some tiredness occurring». Don’t continue thinking «I’m so tired, I
want to sleep», «my meditation will go much better if I had a sleep now», «I
will have a good sitting after lunch». Don’t start listening to this nonsense!
There is some tiredness occurring. «I am so tired, I really need to sleep, my
meditation will go much better if I sleep. I need 9 hours a day. I can’t function.» Have a look if your mind starts going into that.</p>
<p>Have a look if your mind starts having states of boredom. If you are
not noting and knowing, of course, you will be experiencing some boredom.
Who wants to sit in a hall for nine hours a day and not doing anything?
<em>Of</em>
<em>course it’s boring, so you will need to start meditating!</em>
If you start to attach
with states of boredom, what does it mean? «I am boring.» So you become a
boring person if you start to identify with your mind states. There’s nothing
boring here, but there maybe some boredom occurring in your mind. Please
be aware of that. See it for what it is. See dullness, see the lethargy, see the
flatness and the apathy.</p>
<p>If you started thinking in that way, if you started looping in that way,
then you’re going to be causing yourself a lot of distress. You’re going to be
getting yourself upset. You’re going to start freaking out. So stop it! Just stop
it and have a look at the mind. Stop it from being slack and inactive. Start
noting.  Starting  being  aware  of  whatever  physical  posture  you  are  in.  Be
aware of the rising and falling. Be aware of sounds and smells and sights. Be
<span class="pdfpage">123</span>  aware of all the stuff that is going on.</p>
<p>In the beginning stages it might seem a bit boring to watch the breath,
but once we start to connect with it, wow, you will see that it is anything
but boring. In fact, it will become the most fascinating thing you have ever
experienced once you connect with the breath, once your mind goes into the
breath and becomes one with the breath truly able to follow it in the present
moment. You will find that it is an extremely fascinating thing.</p>
<p>It’s just a matter of checking your attitude and then redirecting yourself  to  the  practice.  Directing  yourself  away  from  your  looping,  habitual
thoughts of negativity. Just step out of that pattern that’s going on. Step out
of it and start doing the practice! In that way you will be able to overcome
that state of sleepiness, of sluggishness or boredom.</p>
<p>Practical  things  we  can  do  to  overcome  sleepiness  and  tiredness
include: take a shower, splash water on yourself, look up into the bright sky,
fill your mind with light, pull your ears. In your walking meditation you can
walk a bit faster for the first five minutes. Build up some momentum, build
some energy up. If you’re creeping around super, super slow for 40 minutes,
you may not be becoming invigorating enough, you may not have enough
energy to keep noting.</p>
<p>If you are feeling tired in the sitting meditation, open your eyes. Or if
you are feeling so tired that you’ve started nodding, just stand up and meditate and then sit down again. We are just transitioning between postures –
meditation takes place in the mind. It is mind training. It doesn’t matter what
posture your body is in. Traditionally we sit in the cross legged posture but
it’s quite possible to meditate in chairs, to meditate while standing or walking. It’s even possible to meditate while we are lying down. So use all these
postures and develop continuous awareness. This will help you to overcome
the third hindrance.</p>
<p>When you’re becoming weary or slack, notice when the mind is tired.
Vigorously  note  it  when  the  mind  is  feeling  tired  until  the  point  where  it
steps back and the tiredness is over there and your awareness and wisdom
are over here. Two different things. Two completely separate things and you
can choose whether you want to go into the tiredness or whether you want
to stay in alertness. Tiredness just becomes another object. When we are not
<span class="pdfpage">124</span>  in it, when we are not identifying with it, it’s not you that’s tired, there is
tiredness! Start to view these hindrances through the prism of the four noble
truths.</p>
<p>The  four  noble  truths  always  start  with
<em>«there  is..  »</em>.  That’s  the  way
the  Buddha  instructed  us  to  see  the  four  noble  truths.  There  is  suffering.
There is tiredness. There is wanting. There is aversion. There is disliking.
<em>It is not you!</em>
But that is what is arising in the present moment right now.
You can step away from that. Stop conditioning your mind with those states.
Normally, we go into them and start conditioning the mind and then we’ll
become  those  states. A  craving  person,  an  angry  person  or  a  lazy  person.
We keep fueling ourselves with this. We keep programming ourselves with
these hindrances and then that’s what we become. So be very aware and very
careful not to start indulging in these mental states when they are coming up
and disturb our meditation.</p>
<p>The  Buddha  gives  a  simile  of  a  pond,  that’s  covered  by  some  green
vegetation. Pond scum. When that stuff is growing on the water, you can’t
see into the water. You can’t see the clear water of the pond. It’s temporarily
covered. So just push away that pond scum.</p>
<p>Make a note: ‘tiredness, laziness, boredom’ is there. Make a note and
let it go. It may take five or six notings, it may take 10 times to note for a
particular mental state. In the initial stage we do it once or twice and it might
disappear a little bit then it comes back. We note it again. And we know it
again. We keep noting it. We keep hammering it away until it gets the idea:
this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. We start to separate from
the mental state.</p>
<p>If we stop identifying with these mental states, they loose all power.
They loose their conditioning power. They loose their ability to act as a base
or a foundation for the sense of self. Me, mine and I simply can’t arise when
we are noting and knowing persistently in the present moment.</p>

<section id="fourth-hindrance-uddhachakukkucca">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.4. </span>Fourth hindrance uddhachakukkucca<a class="headerlink" href="#fourth-hindrance-uddhachakukkucca" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The  fourth  hindrance  is  known  as
<em>uddhachakukkucca</em>,  which  means
restlessness and worry. This is the type of mind state that comes upon us,
when we start to worry about things. We become restless about things. You
<span class="pdfpage">125</span>  have all experienced this wandering mind. It’s wandering here, it’s wandering there. It’s unrest. It’s wanting something else. It’s desiring to anything. It
wants to read something. It’s getting anxious about something. Maybe you’re
starting to having withdrawals from information. We are all used to being
bombarded with so much information. We haven’t got our devices or books
with us. So the mind starts getting a little bit restless. It hasn’t got its normal
toys to play with. So it’s becoming more and more restless.</p>
<p>Planning  the  future  –  it’s  wandering.  Thinking  about  what  it’s  going
to be doing next week. Planning to make your life a success in someway.
Maybe you are thinking about the past, long forgotten memories are coming
up. You’re starting to play to go through old conversations. Recognize when
the mind is wandering. Make a note ‘wandering, wandering, remembering,
remembering, planning, planning’. Quite often we spend most of our time
just wandering in thoughts in the future, planning things that will never come
true. Just nonsense! Of course, you all need to make decisions at some point
in your life and we can do that with wise attention. We can decide how we
make our decisions wisely depending on what the causes or purposes of our
motivation is. We can see which is the best decision to be made in that way.
Become  aware  if  you  are  having  concern  for  outside  things.  If  your
mind is wandering to the outside. Maybe you’re becoming restless. Maybe
you’re  becoming  upset.  Maybe  you  are  feeling  guilty  about  something.
Maybe you are experiencing some fear or maybe you are scared of something.</p>
<p>Be sure not to condition yourself with these kind of thoughts, sometimes irrational thoughts. We’ll get in all kind of phobias, all kinds of belief
systems when we start to believe our own thoughts. We start to listen to these
very impermanent, dependently arisen, conditioned thoughts that come up
and pass away. They arise and pass away. Arise and pass away. We take them
very seriously. We start to identify with them. Of course, they cause us much
trouble.</p>
<p>Maybe you are worrying about the retreat. «I am trying hard, but it’s
not  working.  I’m  not  going  to  get  any  results.  I  am  hopeless.  It  is  day  3
already  and  I  am  still  not  enlightened.  What’s  wrong?»  You  are  used  to
achieving, setting your goals but it’s not working. Your expectations are not
<span class="pdfpage">126</span>  fulfilled.  You  are  becoming  restless  and  upset  or  you  are  worrying  about
your meditation results. Maybe you’re worrying about what other people are
going to think about you, when you tell them about your meditation results.
All kinds of things that people worry about and get stressed about. No-one
is interested in what your meditation is doing, except me. I’m of course very
interested and hope that you’re along the path. But don’t think that you have
to try and achieve something or get something by you or for you.</p>
<p>This  can  be  big  source  of  problems  for  people.  They  want  so  very
much to get it. And then of course after two days of tiredness, it’s not working, you become upset. «It’s not working. This system doesn’t work. I have
tried now.»</p>
<p>No! It is just like going to the supermarket and buying the ingredients
and then say the cake does not work. But you have to make the cake first,
you have to do the cooking. Buying the ingredients is not enough. You actually  have  to  do  some  work. Vipassana  is  exactly  the  same.  Just  sitting  on
the mat with your eyes closed and waiting for some insight to fall from the
heaven – it just does not happen like that! No! Insights are conditioned, it’s
conditioned phenomena. You all need to put the conditions in place and we
are all working towards that. The more efficiently and effectively you can
line up all the conditions, that is when the magic starts to happen. If you are
neglecting  some  particular  condition,  then  start  to  work  on  that  one.  The
things I have been saying, all need to be put into the actions. They are all
conditions for the arising of insights.</p>
<p>The wandering mind can be very useful. It teaches us that things are out
of control. It teaches us that thoughts just keep coming, they just keep arising. Meditation practice is not to stop the thinking. We are trying to observe
it, to watch it and detach from it. You’re not interested in perpetuating the
thinking. Don’t fuel it by thinking about it again and again. What happens
when you do that? We all know! You become upset. When there is an object
of resentment and then you keep thinking about it again and again, then you
get yourself upset. This is how we become upset, through constantly thinking about something that we think is negative. If we get in a serious habit
of that, then we get depression. Or, we end up with anxiety. We end up with
some  serious  mental  disorder,  because  of  the  thinking.  It’s  just  thoughts!
<span class="pdfpage">127</span>  There is nothing wrong with you, but no-one taught us to have a look at these
thoughts before. Step back from them, they are not you. They don’t belong
to you, nothing to do with you! It’s conditioned phenomena. If you identify
with them, dukkha! If you don’t identify, freedom! So start to step back from
your  own  mind,  from  the  thoughts,  the  restlessness  and  worrying.  Don’t
follow the story. That is what this restlessness is all about. We haven’t been
fast enough in noting the thoughts. A thought has come up and then it started
blossoming into a story. And we started following along with that story. So
try to note the thoughts before they start to turn into stories. Before they take
you away for 10 minutes to another country, to another conversation with
another person, and then you wake up when you hear the bell.</p>
<p>Knowing that we are thinking, that those five hindrances are within us
is already a good start. We need to be able to recognize them, see when we
are being attacked by them, and then step away from them. It is not good
enough to recognize that they are there and then continue to allow them to
keep going. We want to cut that behavior. It is not easy! Because our reaction
patterns have become habitual, we have probably reacted in the same way
for 20, 30 years. It has become a habit. So we are addicted to our reaction
patterns. We think that is who we are. «I don’t like this, this, this and this.»
It’s  already  been  decided  that  these  things  are  bad  and  need  to  be  pushed
away. So every time, when we encounter them, reaction. Dukkha. Reaction.
Dukkha. Every time we come in contact with those things, dukkha. Try to
step  away  from  that  position,  even  if  you  have  been  holding  that  position
for a long time. Try to step away from your views, opinions. These views
and opinions are just rooted in wrong view. They don’t belong to anybody.
Don’t become a person that has become fixed in their wrong view. The older
people get, the more and more they are fixed in the ways of doing things.
«This  is  the  exact  way  you  need  to  make  a  cup  of  tea.  First  tea  bag,  then
water, then milk.» If you put first the milk in, then they start reacting in this
way. It’s just a simple habit that we got used to. And then we think the tea
tastes somehow differently. They can get quite upset, and even not drink the
cup of tea.</p>
<p>So have a look at those kinds of little patterns that we get ourselves
into the trouble that these patterns make. Everything is up for auction in the
<span class="pdfpage">128</span>  mind. All the mind states can be let go of! None of them belong to you. Get
rid of it. Let it go. Let go of the thoughts and patterns. Free the mind from its
tendency to be in a certain way.</p>
<p>The Buddha gives us a simile of wind whipped water. It’s like water out
there on the ocean on a windy day. Lots of little white caps. You can’t see
down to the sand. The surface of the water is uncalm. It’s disturbed.</p>

<section id="fifth-hindrance-vicikiccha">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.5. </span>Fifth hindrance vicikicchā<a class="headerlink" href="#fifth-hindrance-vicikiccha" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The fifth hindrance is known as skeptical doubt or
<em>vicikicchā</em>
or skepticism. It’s uncertainty, doubt in the mind. Sometimes we start experiencing
doubt. We are unsure about the practice. We are hesitating. We are uncertain
about  what  we  are  doing.  Perhaps  you  are  uncertain  about  the  Buddha’s
teaching.  Maybe  you’re  not  quite  sure  if  the  Buddha  was  correct  or  not.
Maybe you are doubting about the meditation technique that we are teaching here. Maybe you’re having doubt about me as being a teacher. Maybe
you’re having doubts about your own ability to do the practice. Maybe you’re
having thoughts of low self-confidence. You’re doubting the practice and you
are  doubting  yourself.  You  are  switching  between  meditation  techniques,
sometimes at the nose, sometimes at the abdomen. «I do it this way then I
do it that way.» The mind is not confident enough to fulfill the training. The
faculty of confidence or faith, the faculty of
<em>saddha</em>
is weak.</p>
<p>You  need  to  boost  up  that  a  little  bit. You  need  to  become  confident
with what we’re doing here. People have been doing this for a long time and
experiencing  the  results.  Your  ability  to  put  the  instructions  into  practice
will  determine  the  results  of  your  practice. You  shouldn’t  have  any  doubt
about that. This is a conditioned, impersonal process. It has got nothing to
do with you! We are putting in place various conditions and then it happens
by itself. It’s beyond our control. So have no doubt about that! Just put the
instructions in place!</p>
<p>Have a look at this mind state of doubt. It can really destroy your practice. If you start to think «this technique is hopeless», or «I can not do it, this
is not what I want», you’ve tipped yourself out. You’ve fallen over. See if
you are entertaining thoughts of doubt.</p>
<p><span class="pdfpage">129</span>  So these are the five hindrances. Sensual desire and ill will, laziness
and  boredom,  restlessness  and  worry  and  skeptical  doubt. These  five  hindrances will come and attack us in our meditation practice. Many things we
do on this retreat are specifically designed to overcome these five hindrances.
We are working on restraining our sense doors. We are restraining our
food intake. We are keeping the eight precepts. If we have a look at the eight
precepts, we will see that actually the sixth, seventh and eighth precepts are
all about restraining the sense doors. We are restraining by eating food only
in the morning. We are restraining the delight that can arise at the tongue
door. We are not dancing, singing, listening to music. We are restraining the
ear door and the body door in those activities. We are not watching shows,
DVDs  or  films.  So  we  are  restraining  the  eye  door. We  are  not  using  perfumes and flowers so that we can restrain the nose door. We are not sleeping
on high and luxurious beds. So we’re restraining the body door.</p>
<p>This  is  a  restraint  mechanism  so  that  we  can  practice.  We  need  to
restrain these five hindrances from arising and we need to restrain the sense
doors so sensuality or sensual desire doesn’t start to arise. This is all to overcome the first hindrance of sensual desire.</p>
<p>We  are  practicing  the  loving  kindness  meditation  as  an  antidote  to
anger or frustration or irritations so that we don’t have ill will and aversion
in our mind.</p>
<p>We are being moderate in our eating taking just two meals a day. We
are devoted to wakefulness, getting up very early and going to bed quite late.
We’re devoted to being awake and alert while on the retreat here. This is so
that we can overcome the third hindrance of laziness and boredom.</p>
<p>All the activities on the retreat here are to overcome something. They
are an aid to us. So try to join in the restraints for your benefit!</p>
<p>We have a fixed schedule so we don’t need to worry about what to do.
We are removing those kind of distractions of choosing where we can go or
what we can do. There is no choice. We are just following along here. We are
following the precepts that we don’t have to worry that our sila or morality
or virtue isn’t at the right level for our meditation practice.</p>
<p>And of course, we are doing the chanting and bowing to develop faith
and confidence in the Buddha’s teachings and the sangha. And we developed
<span class="pdfpage">130</span>  a measure of confidence within ourselves as well. We gain a reflective acceptance of the teaching. We are listening to the talks, understanding, putting
the practice into action. We are developing a measure of confidence and faith
in the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
<p>Have a look at the translation on your chanting sheets. There are nine
qualities of the Buddha, six qualities of the dhamma and nine qualities of the
sangha that we can recollect.
<em>Buddhanusati, dhammanusati, sanghanusati</em>.
That word sati at the end means mindfulness. Mindfulness of the qualities of
the Buddha, of the dhamma and the sangha. Start to appreciate the gloriousness of the Buddha’s teaching! Start to appreciate how deep and profound
the  dhamma  is.  And  appreciate  those  people  who  have  come  across  the
teaching before us and have done the practice and have realized the results
for themselves. They are the ones who have passed the knowledge down to
us! So we can also come in touch with that teaching. Faith and confidence is
as such developed to remove doubt.</p>
<p>It is important to know that these mind states are objects of our mediation. They are not just disturbances. Don’t think you can’t meditate because
of the hindrances. They are the objects, the things we need to be watching.
They are the things which cause troubles. That’s where the dukkha is coming
from. These five hindrances. Sensual desire – not getting it, unhappy. Anger
– getting it, not happy. When we are lazy and bored – not happy. When we
are restless and agitated – we’re not happy. When we are doubting and lacking  confidence  –  not  happy.  Dukkha  is  arising  when  we  are  entertaining
these five hindrances. So you will need to note and know them and let them
go. None of them are you! They don’t belong to you. If you identify with
them,  dukkha!  If  you  can  note,  know  and  let  them  go,  than  you  are  free!
You have freed the mind from them. And do it again! Train the mind to be
free – that is all what our mediation practice is about. We are training the
mind to be free in any situation! Whatever is arising in the present moment
can be noted, known and let go of! All conditioned objects have the same
structure. They all arise, get clung to, stop getting clung to, and pass away.
Now, how long they stay, depends on how long you identify with that state.
If you’re identifying with it strongly, then you will have all day this state of
agitation. You pick it up in the morning and it will be disturbing you all the
<span class="pdfpage">131</span>  way through to lunchtime until you find something else to be distracted by.
But  if  you  can  note  it  quickly  –  dissolved! Very  rapidly! And  then  a  new
object – and dissolved. Dissolved. Dissolved. If we can get our mind into a
stable mode of perception, with awareness and wisdom continuously arising, noting, knowing every object – then we get ourselves into a state which
is called
<em>udayabbaya ñāṇa</em>, the knowledge of arising and passing away. We
start  to  see  all  mental  and  physical  phenomena  arising  and  passing  away
very, very rapidly because nothing is being identified with. It is all being let
go of! Very, very quickly. Until the mind drops. Until the objects stop passing away and the mind goes into cessation. It stops identifying with all the
rapidly arising and passing away phenomena, that we have been able to note
continuously – nothing getting identified with that state of mind, there is no
sense of self arising, just conditioned phenomena until – whoop, this thing
goes out, «wfuuh», like a candle that you put out with the wind of your hand,
«wfuuh». It’s gone. The mind and body process ceases. It turns into cessation
mode and things temporarily cease. Dukkha ceases. This is a little taste of
the deathless. Not a full taste of nirvana but it is something quite close. And
that is all within reach of our meditation retreat this week.</p>
<p>Don’t  beat  yourself  up,  if  you  find  yourself  under  attack  by  the  five
hindrances. We are all. We all have to work through them. We just need to
deal with them patiently, have tolerance. Don’t become tricked by the mind
into becoming upset by your mind state. Have a look around you. It’s a so
delightful environment here and the food is very good. All you need to do
is to have a look at your mind and see what is really going on there. Don’t
attach to these hindrances. Don’t pick them up when you notice that they are
floating around. Our job is to note them, to know them and to let them go.</p>
