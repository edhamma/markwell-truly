<p><span class="pdfpage">1</span>   Welcome to Wat Kow Tahm insight meditation center. This afternoon
we are going to have an orientation talk for our seven day silent meditation
retreat. First of all I always like to start the retreat by offering our thanks to
Mae Chee Ahmon Pun, our 92 year old nun, that lives here in the monastery and also to Steve and Rosemary Weissmann, who helped develop this
meditation center. Over 25 years they taught more than 8000 people here.
They  developed  this  whole  meditation  center.  Rosemary  and  Steve,  with
some of you may have meditated with, came here when Rosemary was 35.
She left a couple of years ago when she was 60. So we always like to thank
them for their hard work they’ve done to develop this place. The buildings,
the walkways, the gardens, the meditation areas, all the terraces, everything
they have carved out of the jungle. So we are really very much appreciative,
that we could walk into this place two years ago and everything is set up for
us to do meditation retreats here.</p>
<p>Essential to their activities, Mae Chee Ahmon Pun, our nun, has been
here for 50 years. We have Mae Chee Nanika, who has been cooking here on
every retreat, every month for the last 27 years. So we thank them for their
efforts in the work in developing the center and giving us the chance to come
and practice here.</p>
<p>Koh  Phangan  is  very  famous  for  its  full  moon  party  and  its  various
<span class="pdfpage">2</span>   other parties, but there is another aspect to the island. There is a lot of yoga
and other healing types of workshops going on, all types of spiritual activities are going on on the island and many types of meditations from many
different traditions.</p>
<p>We  offer  our  retreat  here  in  the  hope  that  Koh  Phangan  will  lead  to
your spiritual evolution and allowing us to become more useful members of
society. Keep that in mind when you’re meditating this week.</p>
<p>This orientation talk is meant to give us some introduction and some
additional information as to the purpose of our meditation retreat here. We’ll
be talking about the word «meditation». We’ll be talking about a «retreat».
We will also go through a few of the guidelines that we like to follow here
and also we’ll be having a look at the silence.</p>
<p>I very much and warmly welcome you here. Let’s have a good retreat
together.</p>
<p>After I finish this orientation talk, you will have the opportunity to ask
questions, that you may have before we enter into the silence.</p>
<section id="meditation">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#meditation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>First  of  all,  let’s  have  a  look  at  this  word  «meditation».  What  is  the
meaning of meditation? We use it to refer to training of the mind. To the cultivation and development of particular mental faculties. The faculty of faith
and confidence, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness or awareness, the faculty of concentration and the faculty of wisdom. These five faculties are what we are referring to, when we are talking about meditation.
When we are developing meditation, we are developing particular qualities
of the mind, that come to increase and grow in strength, which leads us to
deep and profound understandings and insights.</p>
<p>So the Buddha’s teaching is often divided into samatha and Vipassana,
or calmness meditation and insight meditation. Here we will be practicing
satipatthana or the foundations of mindfulness, which leads to both samatha
and Vipassana practice. We will be joining them both together. Just like a
bird has two wings, we join them together, so we can make the mind stabilize and then we can see things as they really are. We will talk more about the
meditation  practice  later  this  evening.  Satipatthana  meditation  is  all  about
investigating  our  own  mind  and  body  process.  Over  the  next  seven  days,
we will be attempting to continuously activate our awareness in the present
<span class="pdfpage">3</span>   moment. We will be trying to stay in the present moment and internalizing
this present moment awareness into our bodies. So we will be in the present, internalized, and we are trying to do this continuously. Try to remember
these three words: present moment, internal, continuously. That’s what we
are  trying  to  do  here  on  the  retreat.  We  are  observing  our  own  mind  and
body  process  looking  at  our  body,  its  physical  sensations  here  and  there,
looking at our mind, its mental states and its thoughts. We are looking at the
pleasantness and unpleasantness that can arise both from physical sensations
and mental sensations. We are observing our reactions to things, our liking
and  our  disliking.  We  will  be  most  interested  in  observing  our  identification and appropriation of mental and physical phenomena. Our meditation
practice here this week, it’s only about investigating this thing here. We want
to understand what this mind and body process is. This is what meditation
practice  is  all  about  in  the  Buddha’s  teaching.  We  are  investigating  it,  so
that we know it and see it clearly. This is the meaning of Vipassana, to see
things clearly. The only thing we need to understand and see clearly is our
own mind and body process. The rest of it works itself out. It’s fine just as
it is. We do have issues, however, in our mind and body process. So we will
be investigating them, primarily to see them as impermanent, to see them as
unsatisfactory, relatively, and to see them as non-self, to see them as impersonal. The mind and body process is impermanent, it is unsatisfactory and
it is impersonal. It doesn’t belong to anybody, it doesn’t belong to you. Let’s
investigate that all for ourselves.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the meditation practice is to remove the sense of
self,  which  is  arising  continuously  in  the  present  moment.  Consciously  or
unconsciously  we  are  appropriating  and  identifying  our  sense  experience.
Things that we see and smell and taste and hear and touch, things that we
think about – we are identifying with them. And this continuous process of
identification over many years has built up a continuous expression of me
and mine, turned it into an I. It has turned into a self. And so this momentary
identification with phenomena has crystallized, become more concrete and
become a self. It’s become a person, it’s become a personality. So we will be
investigating all those things in this retreat, trying to free ourselves from this
delusion or this very persistent illusion.</p>
<p><span class="pdfpage">4</span>   Having  said  that,  meditation  is  neither  easy  nor  difficult,  but  it  does
take  some  patience.  It  does  take  some  perseverance. You  will  need  to  put
forth a lot of effort. You will need to be determined and you’ll need to be
disciplined. I have spoken to everyone about following the schedule of the
retreat, which is designed to keep you continuously practicing. This is the
most important part of our meditation retreat. Don’t think that the meditation finishes when I’m ringing the bell and the sitting ends. There are formal
walking meditation periods and there are formal sitting meditation periods.
The real meditation goes on during the daily activities, when we try to keep
our mind in the present moment, keep it from running off into the past and
running  off  into  the future, keeping it present, keeping it local, keeping it
internalized.  If  we  can  do  that  during  the  breaks,  when  we  come  in  here
and  sit  and  do  our  sitting  practice,  or  out  on  the  terraces  doing  the  walking practice, then the mind is going to be able to come together much more
efficiently and much more effectively. So please try to be as continuous as
possible in your meditation practice.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s meditation practice is not just to make us feel calm and
peaceful. It’s much more than that. It’s not about developing psychic powers
like telepathy or clairvoyance or clair-audiancy. It’s not about the escaping
reality either. Satipatthana meditation is not just a relaxation technique. We
are not just trying to be calm and cool and happy. We are not just coming
here to bliss ourselves out. The Buddha’s meditation is all about the cessation of dukkha, the cessation of suffering. So that’s what we will be doing
here this week.</p>
<p>Our  meditation  practice  is  a  learning  process. We  are  learning  about
things. It’s an investigative process not a creative process. We are not creating  objects  so  that  we  can  watch  them. We  are  watching  nature. We  are
observing and investigating nature as it’s arising, when it’s arising in its natural  state.  We  don’t  want  to  be  using  external  objects.  There  is  no  need  to
create an image or object we are going to meditate on. We are using our own
mind  and  body  process. That  is  the  object  of  our  meditation.  Real  things,
that are occurring in the present moment. That will give us a clear view or a
clear seeing of the nature of reality. If we want to understand reality, we are
going to have to investigate just reality. Investigating concepts or stabilizing
<span class="pdfpage">5</span>   on concepts doesn’t leave to us understanding the true nature of reality. We
need to work with the real objects in real time for us to see things clearly as
they are.</p>
<p>So in mindfulness meditation we are not trying to do anything. We are
not trying to make anything. We are just watching and waiting and watching
and  seeing  what  is  happening  as  it  unfolds. We  are  not  wanting  anything.
We are not expecting anything. We are observing. We’ve bought a ticket to
the cinema and we are watching the show. We are not getting involved with
the show. We are not jumping up on the stage with the actors in the theater.
We are sitting back, reclining in our seat and watching what’s going on. So
our meditation practice is hands off. It’s turning our experience of the mind
and body process into an objective field of objects that are arising and passing away. We will be using those objects as the foundation for mindfulness.
We  need  to  practice  simply  and  continuously.  We  are  not  trying  to  make
something happen and we are not resisting anything either. We are not trying
to push anything away. We are not trying to make anything disappear. We
are not trying to create something. We are being present. We are activating
our awareness in the present moment and observing what’s there. You’re not
going to an object in trying to be mindful of it. The object has already passed
away if we do that. We are activating our awareness, so that we are present,
and, we are seeing the object of consciousness. And we are doing that over
and  over  again.  Activating  our  awareness,  seeing  what  is  there,  stepping
back from it, disengaging from it, so that it can pass away.</p>
<p>So  we  are  being  in  the  present,  we  are  just  staying  in  the  present
moment,  being  awake  and  knowing  and  aware.  Don’t  forget  what  is  happening now. Don’t allow your mind to go wandering here and there. Don’t
allow it to go into the past or into the future. If your awareness is present
and  if  wisdom  is  also  present,  then  your  mind  will  be  free  in  the  present
moment. And that’s the state of awareness we are aiming for. We are aiming
for freedom in the present moment from our own defilements, from our own
afflictions.</p>
<p>We will need to check our attitude on this meditation retreat. Some of
you have come here a second time, a third time, a fourth time. We need to
check our attitude. Sometimes we have great expectations. Sometimes we
<span class="pdfpage">6</span>   really want to get it. We really want to become a meditator, we really want to
get this. We can be super enthusiastic. We can be super wanting. We desire to
get meditation. We desire to become a meditator. Please check your attitude.
Throw this one out! This is not the type of attitude that you need for meditation. Meditation is exactly the opposite of desire. We are letting go of desire.
Even  of  good  things,  even  for  success  in  meditation.  You  have  all  made
enough effort to arrive here. That is as much desire as you will need to complete the meditation practice. Don’t expect any results. This will create a lot
of anxiety and stress in your meditation practice. Just be cool with whatever
is arising and passing away in the moment. If it’s unpleasant, it’s unpleasant.
If it’s pleasant, it’s pleasant. And there it is and it’s passing away. If we hold
on  to  it,  whatever  the  object  is,  whatever  the  emotional  state  is,  whatever
the repetitive thought is, then we dukkher ourselves. We create suffering for
ourselves by holding and attaching to mental and physical states. When we
see things as they really are, the mind naturally disengages from mental and
physical phenomena. It’s the key to a happy life. It’s the key to understanding  the  mind’s  reactionary  processes.  This  week  we  will  be  talking  a  lot
about the nature and structure of the mind, not only the contents of the mind.
You will be able to, if you follow the instructions carefully, observe this for
yourself. You will be able to see the structure of your mind and how cause
and effect act together. Continuously believing that they are somebody. It’s a
very strange situation, that this thing, that came out of our mothers, this mind
and body thing, this process has come to believe that it is someone. And this
causes a lot of difficulties. When we are not under this false view, when we
are not being attacked by this view, then we are free from the sense of self.
We have gone back to nature. We’ve returned to our true and a beautiful state
of love and compassion, a state of selflessness.</p>
<p>Check  the  quality  of  your  awareness,  if  you’re  observing  the  mind.
Each time you come to the hall here, check your attitude. When you come in
and sit down and you really want to get something, just stop that! Just come
in with the attitude of «well, let’s see what happens.» Every sitting is going
to be different. This week you will be doing more than 50 sittings. There are
going  to  be  some  really  tough  ones. There  are  going  to  be  some  fantastic
ones. And there’s going to be a whole lot in the middle. Some of them boring,
<span class="pdfpage">7</span>   some of them frustrating, some of them kind of okay, some of them tired,
some of them just buzzing and blissful beyond belief, some of them will give
you great insights, some of them will give you great frustrations, some of
them will just be repeating, repetitive conversations with yourself and your
family members, some of them will be silent, some of them will be real meditation, some of them will be thinking. Lots of different sittings this week.
Be prepared for them. Meditation is not just completely being blissed out.
It’s a lot more work than that but the work is extremely rewarding. The work
will lead you to holding the key to releasing your own mind from dukkha.</p>
<p>So we check our attitude. Are you trying to get something? Are you
trying to become something? Why are you meditating? Are you coming to
the hall to get something? Stop that attitude. That’s the wrong attitude. That’s
the attitude of desire.</p>
<p>The present moment is always defined as mind and matter which are
arising independent of desire. When the mind and body process no longer
want something to be different than it actually is, then we are in the present,
right here. If we are always wanting something, if we are always wanting
our experience to be different, then we are always projecting into the future.
We are never quite here. We are not satisfied with what’s present. We want
it to be otherwise. We want it to be different than what it actually is. This is
desire to get something, to change something, to become something. That it
is not what we are looking for. We want to see it as it actually is. So you need
to drop any kind of desire. That wanting is the very mind state that blocks
your meditation. You’re blocking your access yourself by wanting things to
be different than they actually are.</p>
<p>We don’t want to control the experiencing in any way. Our responsibility is right attitude.</p>

<section id="retreat">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Retreat<a class="headerlink" href="#retreat" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Secondly let’s have a look at the word retreat. Retreat means a period
of seclusion for prayer or study or meditation. Retreat also means a place of
security or shelter. All these definitions are given here at Kow Tahm. This is
a period of time of meditation, a place of security and shelter from the world.
Being isolated from the external world a few days and being with yourself in
silence, you really get a chance to have a look at your own mind. For most of
<span class="pdfpage">8</span>   us we haven’t been silent for seven days since we came out of our mothers.
We’ve always been talking, continuously chattering away. But here is no way
to escape our own mind. We’re going to be watching our own mind, our mind
states, our reactions, what we like and dislike, our identification with things.
Here we only have a chance for listening. There’s no Internet and no books to
read and no place to go to. We won’t be able to distract ourself with anything
external. We will be paying attention to the present moment and seeing what
is in our mind. Meditation is mind training. We are going to put the mind on
a leash this week. We try to train it a little bit.</p>
<p>Without these distractions, it’s an excellent opportunity to do our internal work. Usually when we have a problem when we face difficulties, we
like to talk about it with others. Here we don’t do that. Here we examine it.
We observe it to deal with it wisely on our own. We don’t suppress things
and we don’t run away from our mind states. We are patient. There will be
frustrating or agitated moments.</p>
<p>There will be moments when you’re thinking, «what am I doing here.
Really, what am I doing here?». And you start to loop and think about all
the excuses you can find to try and escape. Have a look at those mind states!
Here you have to learn how to deal with your own mind. You won’t be able to
bounce off your mind state with your partner or friends. You can regard your
work as an investigation. There will be unpleasantness. There will be a lot
of pleasantness as well. All different mind states are going to be coming up.
You shouldn’t regard any of these mind states as a problem for your meditation. Nothing is a problem in your meditation practice! Meditation practice
is the removal of the problems! It’s the observing of whatever is there. Every
object can be an object of awareness and wisdom. Every object can be noted,
known and let go of. We are learning how to function in the world without
being  disturbed,  without  creating  suffering  for  ourselves.  That’s  what  the
heart of meditation practice is all about. Learning how to deal with issues.
And the big issue is internal. Really, there’s nothing wrong with the outside
world! Things are as they are. They will be as they will be. What we can do
though, is train our mind, train our reactions to the world.
<em>It’s our reactions</em>
<em>to the external world that creates happiness or unhappiness</em>. If you can see
that, you will be the master of your own happiness. Happiness comes from
<span class="pdfpage">9</span>   non-reaction. Happiness comes from seeing things as they really are. Happiness comes from contentment with how things are in the moment. When
we’re not content with how things are in the moment, we’re not happy. So a
lot of our meditation practice, especially in the first two days, will be about
practicing patience and contentment. Being content to be here and to do the
practice.</p>
<p>Whilst on a retreat, we try not to think about our work or studies. We’re
not interested in our family and friends and what they’re doing this week. We
are focusing on our own work. Just be present, don’t think about the future,
not even next week. A meditation retreat is not a time for you to come and
think  about  your  future.  That  is  not  meditation.  It’s  just  thinking.  It’s  just
your own imagination. The future is uncertain and doesn’t even exist. The
future exists as a thought in your mind in the present moment. Anything to
do with the future, is just your mind right now thinking about the future. It
doesn’t have any objective reality. It’s just what your imagination is doing.
The past is the same. It only comes into existence as a thought arising in the
present moment. The past exists as a thought in the present. The future exists
as a thought in the present.
<em>Past and future have no actual reality beyond
your thinking.</em></p>
<p>On the retreat here you don’t have to use your time organizing or worrying about anything. We will take care of all those things for you. Your job
is just to remain present, to note and know and to let go.</p>
<p>In a retreat setting like this, we learn to become aware of whatever’s
arising in the present moment. We don’t allow our mind to get scattered here
and there. Try to bring it back to the present. If we’ve noticed that we’ve
gone  into  the  past  or  the  future,  bring  it  back.  Nothing  wrong!  The  mind
normally wanders here and there. We don’t get upset, when leaves fall off the
tree. That’s what they do! We don’t get upset, when fish go swimming. That’s
what they do! The mind wanders. So don’t be upset if your mind doesn’t do
what you exactly want it to do. It’s just like a new puppy. You have to train it.
So a meditation retreat like this provides the ideal training facility to
practice  meditation. You  can  consider  this  meditation  hall  as  a  swimming
pool. You spend seven days learning how to swim, learning how to watch
your own mind. The real practice comes, however, when you leave this place
<span class="pdfpage">10</span>   to see if you can swim in the ocean.</p>
<p>Check your attitude, make sure you don’t expect anything to happen.
Sit  back  and  see  what  does  happen! Anything  valuable  does  take  time  to
develop. So don’t worry if it’s not working on the first or second day. Don’t
cling  to  any  pleasurable  experiences  that  may  happen  quickly.  Sometimes
people get very fast results and then they spend the rest of the days trying to
get it back again. Let go of everything that arises whether it’s pleasurable or
unpleasurable. If it’s pleasant or painful, just let it go.</p>
<p>We are trying to keep our mind present and stabilize our awareness in
presentness. Stabilizing our awareness in the stillness of the present, watching whatever flows through the mind and whatever sensations occur in the
body.</p>
<p>We  have  to  adjust  to  a  fairly  vigorous  daily  schedule.  You’re  going
to  have  to  deal  with  bodily  discomfort. You’re  going  to  have  to  deal  with
habitual  thought  patterns.  Our  job  is  to  observe  what  is  arisen,  step  back
from it, disengage and allow it to be let go of. We are observing things to the
point that they are so clearly, that the mind can no longer use it as a base for
self. It’s discarded. It only has use when it can be a base for the sense of self.
If that object is being used as a sense of me, mine or I, or as a condition for
the arising of me, mine or I, then it is still useful for creating that. You’ll be
stuck in it. If you can disengage from that, stop identifying with the object,
then you’re able to free yourself from the object. The problem doesn’t come
from the object, the problem comes from your identification with the object.
Your  attachment  to  it! We  identify  with  our  own  bodies,  we  identify  with
many different things and social concepts, that have come to surround us.
We are identifying with them. We are creating a sense of self out of them
both from internal and external sources. We have built this fine sense of me.
The Buddha’s teaching is to allow us to see this illusion, to see the fact that
we are actually living in the matrix.</p>
<p>Fortunately  for  us  there  is  a  way  out. The  Buddha’s  teachings  is  the
way to escape from the reality that we are living in.</p>
<p>When  you  experience  various  discomforts,  you  might  have  trouble
understanding what’s going on. You’ll be in your own reactive mind state.
Unpleasantness – got to move, got to get out of here. Pleasantness – more,
want  to  stay.  That’s  how  we  normally  react.
<em><span class="pdfpage">11</span>   We  are  normally  completely</em>
<em>conditioned  by  feeling.  The  citta  sankhara,  the  mind  conditioner.</em>
Feeling
is  conditioning  everything.  Unpleasant  feelings  are  conditioning  thoughts
of disliking, which turn into aversion and then anger, pushing things away.
Pleasant  feelings  turning  into  liking,  wanting,  desiring,  craving,  pulling
things towards us. Pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings are conditioning the mind, conditioning our experience.</p>
<p>So we will be examining those feelings states. The state of pleasantness or unpleasantness in the present moment, so that we can free our mind
from  these  states.  The  states  will  still  be  there.  There  will  still  be  pleasantness or unpleasantness, but you just won’t attach to them anymore. You
won’t  identify  with  them  anymore,  so  they  won’t  cause  you  any  distress,
worry or concern. When we stop identifying with them, they will pass away
extremely  rapidly.  If  we  identify  with  something,  we’re  holding  it  and  it
stays. When we see something clearly with Vipassana insight, we’ve seen it,
it’s let go of and it passes away. Attachment leads to suffering, clear seeing
leads  to  letting  go.  Our  meditation  practice  is  all  about  letting  go.  Please
adjust your attitude if you’ve come here thinking that meditation is to try and
get something. We haven’t come here to get anything. We’re not going to get
anything here. There’s nothing here to get and there’s nobody that gets anything. Meditation is the practice of letting go. So please adjust your worldly
stats. The way that we normally view the world is to achieve and get stuff.
Meditation is exactly the opposite. We are doing as much as we can to let go
of things. We are trying to release and relinquish things. I hope you haven’t
come here to get something, to get meditation. Here we’ve come to let go
of all things. The more you can let go of, the more your mind will stabilize,
the more you’ll see in the present moment. As we start to do the meditation
practice, we’ll talk about the various objects that need to be let go of in order
for us to experience the state of calmness in which real insight can arise.</p>
</section>
<section id="guidelines">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Thirdly,  let’s  talk  a  little  bit  about  some  guidelines,  some  rules  and
regulations that make it comfortable for us to stay here. Don’t regard them as
some kind of control. Just try to regard them as conditions. We are putting
in place the suitable conditions for the arising of insight. These are agreements <span class="pdfpage">12</span>   to benefit all of us so that we can live harmoniously and peacefully
together  doing  the  practice.  It’s  wonderful  when  50  people  are  in  silence
living together for a week. You will get to know each other in a certain way,
in silence, and it’s wonderful to see each other after the retreat as well.</p>
<p>All of us have a strong commitment to stay here for the full retreat. Be
determined to follow all the activities and follow the schedule completely.</p>
<p>Most of us take a lot of interest in our bodies. We like to put nice clothing on and paint it in various ways. Here, we don’t worry too much about
that. We don’t need to get dressed up. However, always dress properly, cover
your shoulders and your knees, cover your midriff as well. Please don’t lie
down anywhere except for your room. Please don’t point your feet towards
the speaker or the Buddha in front here.</p>
<p>We  ask  you  to  only  practice  the  meditation  technique  we  do  here.
Those who continuously choose to switch between different techniques, will
have created a lot of doubt in their mind. You won’t know what to do from
moment to moment. You will be all confused. So please don’t bring that confusion into your meditation practice.</p>
<p>Do  your  chore  with  happiness  and  joy  in  your  mind. You’re  giving!
You’re giving something to all of us.</p>
</section>
<section id="silence">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>Silence<a class="headerlink" href="#silence" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Fourthly, I want to talk about silence. Here we are on a silent retreat.
Probably the single most important factor for a successful retreat is the maintenance of the silence. Silence is sometimes called the doorway to insight.
When we’re silent, we start to observe things more intently. We don’t need
to verbalize our thoughts all the time. Our thoughts, instead of being pushed
all the time out of the door of our mouth, they bounce around inside. They
bounce around so that we can see them more clearly. We’re going to be watching them. Of course, it’s normal to have the impulse to talk. We have been
talking all our lives. So it’s normal that we have the wish to talk. Especially
when something funny happens, we would like to make a comment about
that. Please avoid doing that. Please avoid talking or disturbing your roommate or others. It’s not the time to socialize. We regard all talking here as
disturbing. So if you start talking to somebody, you start to disturb them and
their meditation practice. A single sentence can sometimes bounce around
<span class="pdfpage">13</span>   in the head of a person all day. So please be aware that silence is the real
secret to having a good meditation retreat. If you start talking you’re going
to ruin it for yourself and for others. It’s very important that we maintain the
silence – not just silence of the mind, either. Physical communications, even
communications with the eyes. We’re not here to flirt with anyone. You’re not
here to get a new boyfriend or girlfriend. Be aware that your behavior can be
disturbing to somebody who is trying to meditate. We have all come here to
be in silence and to meditate.</p>
<p>You should observe bodily silence as well. Please move around quietly,
especially in the meditation hall. And calmly, and slowly. There’s no need
for you to rush in and out of the hall. Slowly and mindfully come back to the
meditation hall after the walking meditation. There shouldn’t be any gaps in
mindfulness between your walking meditation and your sitting meditation.
There should be one continuous flow over an hour and a half, 45 minutes
each. So try to take the walking and sitting meditation as one unit. Don’t go
to the toilet or to fill your water bottle in the middle of the walking meditation. Your meditation will be more successful if you can be continuous.</p>
<p>This is one of the few places in the world where we can come and be in
silence, where we don’t have to talk. We can enjoy each others company, we
can smile at each other. We’re not saying that you have to be a zombie. Smile
and still be pleasant to each other but don’t disturb each other.</p>
<p>If  you  hear  other  people  continuously  talking,  tell  one  of  the  volunteers. Do not go to them and make «ssshhh». This will cause you a lot of
problems  for  a  few  days. You  will  feel  awful  about  what  you  have  done.
You start to think about it, «oh, why did I do that. I shouldn’t have done it.
What will they think about me.» All kind of thoughts. Every time you see
that person, you get an uncomfortable and unpleasant sensation in the body,
your mind will feel a little bit embarrassed, you turn away from them, feel
uncomfortable.  So  please  don’t  do  that.  It  will  not  be  beneficial  for  your
meditation practice.</p>
<p>Of course, if there is any emergencies, you need to talk. If there is a
snake going into someone’s room, you need to tell them.</p>
<p>So  it’s  important  that  we  keep  the  silence  because  we  understand  its
value  and  its  benefits.  Not  only  for  our  meditation  practice  and  our  spiritual <span class="pdfpage">14</span>   development and our well-being. It’s not just about the rules. It’s about
conditions.  It’s  all  about  putting  the  right  conditions  in  place.  All  of  our
meditation  instructions  are  just  conditions.  We  are  just  telling  you  things
you need to do for your meditation to work. So please try to follow all those
instructions. If you follow all the conditions perfectly, then insight is going
to unfold naturally for you. In fact, you can’t stop it. When all the conditions
are there, it’s going to keep overflowing. Just like when the tap is on and the
pot is full, it just keeps overflowing. The condition is water going into the
pot,  the  result  is  overflowing.  If  all  the  conditions  are  there,  the  dhamma
unfolds naturally by itself. If the conditions are not there, the water is not
flowing, it’s impossible for that water to start overflowing the pot. So think
about  your  meditation  practice  in  this  way.  We  are  putting  conditions  in
place,  the  results  will  completely  take  care  of  themselves.  In  fact,  there’s
nothing you can do to stop it from unfolding if you put the conditions there.
Of course, after the 19th silence will be lifted very early in the morning. At 5.30 in the morning on the 19th.</p>
