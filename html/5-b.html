<p>This afternoon we are going to have a look at the first noble truth, have
a look at
<em>dukkha</em>. There is dukkha.</p>
<section id="first-noble-truth">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.1. </span>First noble truth<a class="headerlink" href="#first-noble-truth" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We’ve  been  using  this  word  dukkha  this  week.  It’s  a  word  that  the
Buddha appropriated from his local language at that time. The word dukkha
means pain. There is pain. He was using it in a different way.
<em>Dukkha sacha</em>,
or the truth of dukkha. The noble truth of dukkha or the noble truth of suffering as it is normally translated. Suffering is kind of an unfortunate translation because it really gives a pessimistic view of the Buddha’s teaching.
People sometimes think, life is suffering, the world is suffering, I am suffering, the Buddha is suffering – the Buddha is not suffering! The Buddha is
free from suffering.</p>
<p>The first noble truth, like all four truths are given to us, is in the fourth
section of the satipatthana text, the contemplation on dhammas. And we get
a definition there of dukkha in the text. The Buddha asks what is dukkha.
<em>«Birth,  old  age,  sickness,  death,  sorrow,  lamentation,  pain,  grief,  and
despair – these are all dukkha. Association with disliked things, separation</em>
<em>from liked things, not getting what one wants – these are all dukkha.»</em></p>
<p>The  Buddha  then  gives  a  very  interesting  ending  to  his  definition  of
dukkha. In summary, «
<em>the five aggregates affected by clinging are dukkha</em>
<span class="pdfpage">194</span>  ».
The  five  aggregates  is  the  Buddha’s  most  common  way  of  analyzing  the
human condition, the mind and body process. He divides us into five groups,
that are joined together, that arise together and cease together. They are very
briefly: (1) physical form, (2) feeling, (3) perception, (4) conditional formations and (5) consciousness.</p>
<p>A few of the translations like suffering, unsatisfactoriness, stress – they
all  bring  with  them  their  problems.  In  countries  like  Thailand  or  Burma,
this  teaching  isn’t  translated. They  just  take  the  word  into  their  language.
Dukkha  is  Thai.  In  the  Myanmar  it’s  the  same.  Very  difficult  to  translate
a concept like dukkha, the noble truth of dukkha and bring it into another
language. This  is  because  other  languages  don’t  contain  this  concept. The
teaching in the Pali text is quite a unique one. Other people didn’t come up
with it. Other people didn’t uncover it. So they don’t have the concepts and
the words to be able to express it. We have to turn to the Buddha’s own word
for him to express the nature of his teaching. Dukkha in our modern world
includes all kinds of depressions, anxieties, stresses and worries, all kinds of
disorders and illnesses.</p>
<p>Essentially, what the Buddha is saying, is, that dukkha is when these
five  aggregates  have  been  affected  by  clinging.  Clinging  is  an  intensified
form of craving; craving brings us to me and mine, clinging brings us to I
– an intensified form with the five aggregates having been not only infected
with craving, but they started to calcify, they started to solidify. More concrete,  these  independent  momentary  appropriations  of  things  as  being  me
and mine come to be joined together, they come to be so continuous that an
image of an I springs up. Just like in a film when it is running through the
projector. Individual frames of me and mine, me and mine, me and mine, me
and mine, me and mine, taking things as happening to me or for me, being
me and mine. Individual events that add up when we run the film through
the projector, we get a movie. And that is what we get, we get a movie of
our  life.  It’s  flowing  through  the  projector.  It’s  hard  to  see  the  individual
moments, where we’re appropriating and identifying, infecting the mind and
body process with this idea of a self. It’s not an easy thing to see, to witness.
That’s what we are here to do. This is what Vipassana is all about, to see this
<span class="pdfpage">195</span>  happening in real time with real data. The real data being your own mind
and body process.</p>
<p>We find in the Pali texts certain usages of the word dukkha. When the
Buddha used the word
<em>dukkha vedana</em>, he is talking about painful feeling, as
opposed to
<em>sukha vedana</em>, pleasing feeling. These two often go together. A
third one
<em>adukkhama-asukhama</em>, a-dukkha, a-sukha, not painful, not pleasant feeling. We call that neutral, adukkhama-asukhama vedana. Three types
of vedana.</p>
<p>Sometimes  the  Buddha  uses  the  word
<em>sankhara  dukkha</em>.  This  is  the
dukkha  that  comes  from  formations.  This  is  the  dukkha  that  we  see  by
having a body. Just the fact that we have this conditioned body arising in the
moment, it’s the dukkha that we understand from the conditioning process
from the mind and body process it is. Just the fact that we have this body is
dukkha, inherent dukkha. It’s the dukkha we get to see from changing posture. It’s the dukkha that forces us to change, forces us to move, forces us
to cure. That’s the type of dukkha that we are curing all the time. Sankhara
dukkha.</p>
<p>Then  there  is
<em>dukkha  lakana</em>.  Dukkha  lakana  is  the  characteristic  of
dukkha such as when we’re looking at impermanence-dukkha and non-self.
One of the three characteristics. It’s a conditioned, dependently arisen phenomena. This is the dukkha we realize in our Vipassana practice when we are
noting and knowing the individual characteristics of the mental and physical
phenomena.  When  we’re  occupied  doing  this  continuously,  moment  after
moment, fully absorbed into doing this activity, noting and knowing, developing equanimity towards the objects without a desire to change anything or
own anything. When that desire drops away, we see dukkha. We see it, that’s
the one we see in our Vipassana.</p>
<p>Finally, there is
<em>dukkha saccha</em>. Dukkha saccha is the truth of suffering. This is the noble truth, inherent suffering. We can’t change the situation.
When things are appropriated and identified with, that’s dukkha saccha, the
truth of suffering. The Buddha asked us to observe it, to know it, fully. He
asks us to know it fully.</p>
<p>In fact that this nama-rupa, the mind and body process is impermanent
and vulnerable to pain, and completely is unable to provide us any security,
<span class="pdfpage">196</span>  or  any  lasting  satisfaction.  It  is  by  its  nature  unsecure  and  impermanent.
It’s arising and passing away. How can we find any security, any long lasting safety in something which is so impermanent, something so changeable,
something so conditioned and dependently arisen, something so impersonal
that  it  is  out  of  control?  It  is  like  trying  to  get  safety  in  an  out  of  control
car shuttling down the highway. Find some safety and security in that! Of
course, there isn’t! And if we do try to hold on to it, dukkha! Dukkha is there
to greet us when we start to own the body.</p>
<p>The Buddha likes to explain and analyze the mind and body process.
And  he  does  so  using  two  major  categories. There  are  other  categories  as
well  but  the  two  major  ones:  the  six  sense  bases  and  the  five  aggregates.
The five aggregates we just briefly touched on but the six sense bases we’ve
been talking about this week, the bases of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body
and  mind.
<em>Suffering  arises  through  these  six  bases.</em>
This  is  where  dukkha
arises in the present moment and this is where dukkha ceases in the present  moment.  If  objects  have  been  appropriated  at  the  six  sense  doors  and
infected with the virus of me and mine, then dukkha is arising at those six
sense  doors.  The  Buddha  said,  the  eye  and  visible  forms  are  dukkha,  the
ear and sounds are dukkha, the nose and smells are dukkha, the tongue and
tastes are dukkha, if they are appropriated and identified with. As they are
themselves they are fine, they are neutral. That’s rupa, neither good nor bad,
it’s just a body, it’s just a manifestation of old karmic intentions arising in
the present moment. It’s physicality. It’s only dukkha if we own it. There is
my physicality. As soon as we take ownership over it, we have dukkhered
it. We are living in dukkha when we are owning the body and mind process.
The Buddha’s first noble truth points this out to us. Have a look, here,
in this body. There is dukkha, appropriated mental and physical phenomena.
He often teaches uses the phrases
<em>«the six sense bases are imperma-</em>
<em>nent».</em>
What is impermanent that is dukkha. What is dukkha that is non-self.
How can you claim ownership, how can you claim to be something which
is impermanent and dependently arisen. When we see it with our meditation
wisdom, we see that the body and the mind is extremely impermanent. It is
laboring under a conditionality process. It is fixed in its dependency. How
can we find any happiness in this thing? And the Buddha is not saying that
<span class="pdfpage">197</span>  life is all terrible. He is saying, when you hold on to it, when you attach and
cling to the mind and body process, then this thing called dukkha arises.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, he gave us the second noble truth as well. He told us,
that dukkha is arising from craving.</p>
<p>And then the third noble truth: this dukkha ceases, this dukkha ends.
It’s possible to put out the flame of dukkha. We can move beyond this first
noble truth. We can realize the third noble truth. There is an end from dukkha,
there is freedom from dukkha. The Buddha called that nirvana.</p>
<p>And the fourth noble truth, that’s the causes and conditions for the arising of cessation, for the arising of the end of dukkha.</p>
<p>The  Buddha  wasn’t  particularly  concerned  with  full  philosophical
completeness.  He  was  much  more  interested  in  a  practical  and  pragmatic
way of practicing. His teaching constantly directs us to the truth. Rarely is it,
that he comes out with a statement exclaiming the truth. He much prefers to
just point out the path that leads to the truth. He wants us to walk that path.
He wants us to understand for ourselves, having realized the truth for ourselves. He was a very skillful teacher in the way he delivered his teachings
for 45 years. On the age of 35, after his enlightenment, until the age of 80,
he wandered the northern area of India teaching. He says,
<em>«now as before, I</em>
<em>teach dukkha and the end of dukkha»</em>. That’s it. 45 years wandering around
teaching about dukkha. Beings understanding those teachings and becoming
enlightened themselves. If there is something that we truly need to understand in this life, it is dukkha! He tells us, that this dukkha needs to be fully
understood in all ways. He tells us that consciousness is arising at these six
sense bases.
<em>He calls these six sense bases the ALL. This is all there is.</em>
There
is nothing outside of this. This six sense basis presents the world to us. We
call it «ALL».
<em>«This is the ALL, monks.»</em>
And he says, the ALL is subject to
birth, sickness and death. When the six sense bases are appropriated – there
is  nothing  wrong  with  the  six  sense  bases  itself,  they  are  actually  fine,  if
we leave them alone – dukkha is produced when we appropriate, when we
identify, when we take ownership of, when we start to build our identity or
our personality based upon this basis, based upon these objects. The mind
has been doing this for a very long time, efficiently and effectively. So completely that there are rarely any gaps. Very rarely does anyone ever have a
<span class="pdfpage">198</span>  gap. Very rarely does anyone get to experience the world without a self being
in  the  way.  Some  people  have  spontaneous  realizations.  Sometimes  great
traumas can trigger this in people. In states of depressions, or great physical
traumas where people get injured they can break through. Sometimes people
have  a  spontaneous  experience  when  they  are  in  nature,  when  they  are  in
the jungle or in the dessert or when they are alone. An experience without a
self in it. When the world is not divided, when it hasn’t slipped into duality,
before it goes to duality, there is a oneness.
<em>Before the sense of self comes</em>
<em>into to divide «now» into «my» and «that» there is a singleness that’s there.</em>
This is the cessation the Buddha is talking about. Some people have random
and spontaneous experiences of it. Not the full enlightenment, not the full
pulling out of the defilements but just a quick glimpse. Some psychedelic
substances give us a weird taste of this experience. Unsustaining though, it
slips away. The Buddha’s teaching is a systematic method and technique that
brings us into the present moment without a sense of self. We can see things
as they really are, freeing our consciousness from this infection.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">12.2. </span>Craving, conceit and views<a class="headerlink" href="#craving-conceit-and-views" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha calls the six sense bases the «world». So this is the world,
the whole world. The whole world is empty of self and that which belongs
to self. He calls the six internal bases old karma. The manifestation of these
six internal bases is the manifestation of old karma. He also says that these
are the six bases of conceivings. Once we are in, once a sense door has been
activated, if consciousness has arisen at that door, feeling has arisen with it,
pleasant or unpleasant – internal object, external object, contacting so that
consciousness arises in the present moment and knows that experience in the
present moment – if this has gone unnoted, if awareness hasn’t been sharp
and  particular  at  this  exact  point  of  contact,  than  that  sense  experience  is
infected by me or mine. It’s infected by craving, conceits and views.</p>
<p>Craving is what takes this experience as being mine. Conceit takes the
experience as «this I am». And wrong views take the experiences as «this
is my self». There are three different types of conceiving, all conceiving in
a  subjectified  way. All  of  different  intensities.  Craving,  conceit  and  views
arise at the six sense doors.</p>
<p><span class="pdfpage">199</span>  Our Vipassana meditation practice is the systematic observation of the
six sense doors. Noting, knowing and letting go what’s going on. We begin
our practice at the body door, watching the rise and fall of the abdomen or
the breath sensation as it passes in and out through the nostril, paying attention to our posture as well. It’s a difficult door. Then we bring the other doors
in, the seeing, the hearing, the smelling and the tasting. We are aware when
these doors are activated. We’re noting every moment we can, to stop the
infection. And then the mind door! In its wanderings, in its versions of the
truth, in its memory, grand plans and dreams. These are also being infected.
These are also being used as base for the arising of self.</p>
<p>So, our practice leads to an abandoning of craving, conceit and views,
leads us to an abandoning of conceiving of what the Buddha called
<em>papanca</em>,
conceptualization.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-six-sense-bases">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.3. </span>The six sense bases<a class="headerlink" href="#the-six-sense-bases" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The six sense bases are our access to the world. This is how the body
interacts. We are calling it
<em>the six doors</em>
sometimes,
<em>the six sense bases</em>
sometimes. The real definition is the
<em>chah ayatana</em>, the
<em>six sense spheres</em>. These
doorways are actually spheres of experience. The ear door for example: the
sphere of the ear is only sound. The ear cannot see, it cannot smell, it only
cognizes sound. The eye door only cognizes visible forms. It doesn’t taste
or smell either. The nose door has its sphere of experience. The tongue has
its sphere of experience. The body door its own. The mind door experiences
all  five  physical  doors  and  its  own  door,  its  own  sphere.  For  example  we
can listen to some music while we are sitting here in the hall. It’s the song
in our head. That’s the mind door open – but we are listening probably to
some  awful  sound  that  you  can’t  get  rid  of,  repeating  and  looping  around
and around.</p>
<p>So  these  spheres,  the  six  sense  bases  are  like  little  radars,  whenever
they are activated. And these six sense spheres, their information is collected
and compiled together. The feeling from all of them is assessed and analyzed
very rapidly by the mind. We very rapidly build a picture or conceptualization of what’s going on, our perception or our recognition. We draw on our
resources  of  previous  recognitions  and  perceptions  to  paint  a  picture.  We
<span class="pdfpage">200</span>  very  rapidly  paint  a  conceptualization  of  what  the  experience  is,  what  the
event is. Of course, built into that experience is the fact that the experience
is happening to me. That’s also another layer of paint that we put on. The
subjective layer of paint. This is happening to me. This is something for me,
this is mine. And it’s through doing this continuously over and over and over
again, that a picture is painted. A very strong identity view arises. It doesn’t
want to be told that it’s nothing. If I tried to tell you, that you are nothing, it’s
not happening to you – «of course it’s happening to me», people say. They
are very unwilling to let go of their sense of self. We are often quite scared!
If there is no me, what will I do? Well, you are free, there is nothing to do
for you. You are lying in the hammock. You are done. Done is what had to
be done. There is no more coming to any state of being. That’s what our goal
as humans is. We meditate ourselves out of existence so that the mind finds
no longer a base upon which it can rest and call «me» and «mine» a home.
Consciousness  unfixed,  consciousness  unsettled,  consciousness  released.
It’s the mind unentangled with the world. The world of mental and physical
phenomena. When consciousness separates, steps away from that, then it is
released. It’s free.</p>
<p>In the Samyutta Nikaya we have a wonderful sutta, called the Malunkyaputta  sutta.  Malunkya  was  a  guy  that  came  to  visit  the  Buddha  several
times. His conversations have been recorded with the Buddha. He came on
many occasions. We can trace his development actually. His first few questions he was quite unsure of what he was talking about. The Buddha set him
straight, gave him a few instructions. He came back, asking deeper and more
profound questions. Finally he came to the Buddha and said, look, just give
me the short version. I don’t have much time. I’m an old man. I just want
to know how to do it really quickly. I just want enlightenment, kind of now,
don’t we all? And so the Buddha gave him this teaching:
<em>«Well, Malunkyaputta, regarding things seen, regarding things heard and sensed and things
cognized by you, in the seen there should be just the seen, in the heard there
should be just the heard, in the sensed there should be just the sensed and in
the cognized there should be just the cognized. When, Malunkyaputta, in the
seen there is just the seen, in the heard there is just the heard, in the sensed
there is just the sensed and in the cognized there is just the cognized – nothing <span class="pdfpage">201</span>  more added – then you will not be ‚by that‘. You will not be ‚therein‘ and
you will not be ‚anywhere between the two‘».</em></p>
<p>When you are not ‘therein’ and not ‘by that’, then you will be neither
here nor there nor beyond the two. Just this is the end of suffering. So when
we  are  no  longer  taking  things  –  things  seen,  things  heard,  things  sensed
(sensed is the nose door, tongue door and body door), things cognized is the
mind door, when you are no longer building your sense of self so that you no
longer be by that or be therein, then we will no longer be anywhere. Being
comes to an end, being ceases. We will no longer be between the two. This
is the end of suffering. Malunkyaputta listened to that carefully and became
fully enlightened. Maybe it will happen to you, I hope so (audience laughing).</p>

<section id="the-five-aggregates">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.4. </span>The five aggregates<a class="headerlink" href="#the-five-aggregates" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The  Buddha’s  main  way  of  analyzing  the  mind  and  body  process  is
the  five  aggregates.  It’s  given  to  us  in  the  definition  of  dukkha,  the  first
noble  truth.  In  short,  the  five  aggregates  affected  by  clinging  are  dukkha.
Aggregate means something joined together, groups compounded together,
things  held  together.  This  looks  at  one  thing  but  it’s  actually  five  things.
Actually five individual things joined together, arising together and ceasing
together.  The  Buddha’s  primary  scheme  for  analyzing  sentient  existence.
It’s the ultimate referent to the first noble truth. The purpose of analyzing
the body in this way is to let go of the mind and body process. The Buddha
wasn’t analyzing the body and mind process into these five groups, so that
we can come upon some scientific discoveries. He is not trying to analyze
to the amino-acids and protons and neutrons and electrons. He is not trying
to analyze every single type of nerve or brain pulsation that we may have.
He is giving us a scheme with which we can practice in the present moment.
He says, the five aggregates need to be fully inspected and fully understood.
We need to know the five aggregates in the past, the present and the future.
We need to know them internally and externally. The gross manifestations
and the subtle manifestations. The inferior and superior manifestations. The
far and near. The purpose of this investigation is liberation, not kind of analytical scientific study where we pigeonhole everything, put the information
<span class="pdfpage">202</span>  over there. That’s the scientific method. Take something, cut it apart, analyze
it, split it up, analyze it and try to understand it in that way. The Buddha is
doing that on the internal bases with the mind, not with the eyes. You don’t
divide the body and mind up with your eyes. How can you divide your mind
with  the  eyes? You  can’t  even  see  the  mind  with  your  eyes.  The  mind  is
immaterial. It is not part of the body. It’s an immaterial experience. We need
the mind to be able to understand the mind, to understand feeling, perception, formations and consciousness. In fact, we need awareness and wisdom
for us to fully understand it.</p>
<p>The  Buddha  tells  us  that  these  five  aggregates  tend  to  affliction  and
cannot be made to conform to our desires. They are out of control, they are
impersonal! He tells us that attachment to them leads to stress, sorrow and
depression  and  that  their  change  leads  to  fear,  anxiety  and  distress. When
we are attaching to it we get depressed, and when we are worried about it,
we develop anxiety. Normally we are attached and concerned about the past.
When we are obsessed with the past, it leads us to a sadness and to a depression. When  we  are  obsessed  with  the  future,  it  leads  us  to  fear  and  worry
and  concern  and  anxiety.  So  we  know,  where  depression  and  anxiety  are
coming from – spending too much time in the past or too much time in the
future. Of course, the past and future are just thoughts arising in the present
moment. Just a thought pattern that we started looping, started to persistently
think about.
<em>«Whatever a bikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon, that</em>
<em>will become the inclination of his mind.»</em>
If we are frequently thinking and
pondering upon a sad event, then guess what happens, we become sad! If we
are frequently thinking and pondering and worrying upon the future, guess
what happens, we become anxious. We condition ourselves into that state by
constantly allowing the mind to loop in a particular thought pattern. We need
to step out of that looping system otherwise we cause ourselves an enormous
amount of problems. Our Vipassana technique is to dissolve this looping in
the  present  moment. That  we  can  move  beyond  habitual  thought  patterns.
We’ll move beyond habitual emotional states.</p>
<p>Sometimes  we  have  an  emotional  state  that  has  been  arising  for  so
long, we don’t know any escape from it. It’s been going on for so long we
don’t  know  any  difference.  People  get  addicted  to  things  for  20,  30,  40,
<span class="pdfpage">203</span>  50 years. Their experience is, that when that object comes into their mind,
wanting, desiring and they go into it. There is a strong connection there. As
soon as the object becomes an object of consciousness, they are straightforward identifying and wanting it. That is just a pattern they picked up. It’s
an addiction. It’s a pattern way of thinking. Our awareness meditation can
break through this. It won’t happen immediately but if you continue noting,
knowing and letting go every time that these impulses arise, you start to see
them as they are. You witness them and you won’t be fooled by them. You
will have strength over them so that we can let them go and move beyond
our attachment and identification with things.</p>
<p>Because  the  five  aggregates  are  impermanent,  they  never  fulfill  our
hopes of permanence and security, while they do give us some pleasure –
that’s for sure! The Buddha says, there is happiness! There is joy going on, it
does arise. He doesn’t say that the world is a barren place of evil and nothing
is happy. That’s not what he is saying. He’s just saying there is dukkha here.
Look out for it. He says whilst the five aggregates do give us pleasure and
joy, they must change, they must alter, they must pass away. And if you are
attached and holding to something that’s passed away – dukkha! If you are
attached to your wallet and loose it – dukkha! Attachment gives the problem.
It’s because of attachment that dukkha arises.</p>
<p>The  story  of  a  guy  who  wakes  up  in  the  morning  after  a  big  storm,
he looks out to the window, to the left, sees a big tree that has fallen on his
neighbor’s car, smashed it completely. «Oh, that’s unfortunate. Dave’s care
has  been  smashed.  Oh  well,  I  hope  he’s  got  insurance.» Then  he  looks  to
the  right  and  sees  another  tree  has  smashed  his  car.  He  completely  freaks
out. «Oh, my car!» Why? The events are exactly the same but the level of
attachment is different. He’s attached to his own car. He gets a lot of suffering from that. «Just lost 20 grant.» Insurance had expired, oops. We can see
it’s attachment that causes us problems. When it’s not my car, «oh, well, I
hope it’s all right». When it’s my car it’s an enormous amount of dukkha.
Problems  and  issues  come  up.  Problems  and  issues  arise  by  taking  things
seriously, by taking them as «me» and «mine». When we do this, our only
companion is dukkha. When you start to release this identification process,
the world opens up, it becomes spacious. How wonderful it is to be homeless. <span class="pdfpage">204</span>  Not have to worry about paying a rent or a mortgage, having to do the
garden or clean the house. All those things, all those problems just disappear
when we are not attached to our dwelling, when we can let them go. When
we let go, we know how it is, when we have a big clean up at home. You go
through and throw away 25 black bags of garbage that you collected. How
freeing that can be! Finally, all those things that we have been holding on to
can be let go of. It’s a clutter. To clear out the clutter of our lives.</p>
<p>It’s  attachment  that  causes  the  problem.  It’s  not  the  object.  Pleasure
does arise in this world. The Buddha says, that we need to understand the
satisfaction, and the danger, and the escape of these five aggregates. We have
to understand, yes they do bring satisfaction. Of course, they are bringing
satisfaction. We wouldn’t identify with them if it wasn’t satisfying. If it was
all total misery, then we wouldn’t be interested in it at all. But because, there
is some pleasantness that’s there, we get sucked into it.</p>
<p>Habitually  we  assume  control  over  the  five  aggregates. We  think  we
are in control but in reality we are devoured by them moment after moment.
These are the domain of defilements. This is where the nasty mental states
arise. Appropriating and identifying.</p>
</section>
<section id="identity-view">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.5. </span>Identity view<a class="headerlink" href="#identity-view" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When we do this, when we take the five aggregates to be a self, there
arises what is known as
<em>sakaya ditti</em>.
<em>Sakaya</em>
means identity or personality.
<em>Ditti</em>
means a view. Our five aggregates become infected with sakaya ditti, or
identity view, or personality view, distorted view of personality. We say that
the five aggregates have come to view. They have attained to view. The five
aggregates have now become an identity instead of being an impersonal flow
of mental and physical phenomena, just cruising along according to karma,
according  to  cause  and  effect,  arising  and  passing.  When  we  don’t  allow
awareness  to  note  and  know  the  present,  when  we  are  out  of  the  present,
when we are unaware, when ignorance is arising, then the five aggregates
are identified with. They come under identity view. And this identity view
happens in four ways over the five aggregates. So there is 20 different types
of identity view.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we regard the body as a self, when we identify a particular aggregate,
<span class="pdfpage">205</span> one of the aggregates as a self. If we regard the body as a self,
or a feeling as self, or a thought or consciousness as self, this is one
way of appropriation. Taking things as a self.</p></li>
<li><p>The second way is taking the experience as happening to me. It’s possessing the experience. We possess the body, the feeling, the perception, the formation or the consciousness. We become the owner. So we
start to identify in that way. Self possesses one of the aggregates.</p></li>
<li><p>The third way in which identity view arises is when we start to think
we contain the aggregate. That the aggregate, the body, the feeling or a
thought is somehow in self. It’s in the self. It’s part of the self.</p></li>
<li><p>And the fourth way is when we take the self as being in the aggregate.
We say the self is in the body, or in the feeling or in the consciousness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So in these four ways we may regard material form as self, or material
form  as  possessed  of  self,  or  material  form  as  in  self,  or  self  as  in  material  form. And  so  on  with  the  other  aggregates.  We  regard  consciousness
as self, or we regard consciousness as possessed of self, or we regard self
as in consciousness, or we regard consciousness in self. So in these ways,
the  mind  and  body  process  come  to  be.  «Being»  is  established,  from  lots
of «me»- and «mine»-experiences, «I» is established, with the sense if «I»,
being has come to be. The mind and body process have become infected by
being. Becoming. There is an identity formed in there. They believe they are
someone. Strongly believe. And when we do this, we start to attend to our
experiences unwisely. We don’t see them as they really are. We start to have
questions when the sense of I arises. Maybe we get a little freaked out, we
start to ask these questions: «Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? How
was I in the past? Where was I in the past? What was I in the past? – I am
now». So it starts to reflect what I was before. It starts to reflect unwisely. Or
it starts to reflect into the future. Identity view starts to be projected forward.
«Shall I be in the future? What shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the
future? How shall I be in the future? Where will I be in the future?» So once
the mind and body starts to believe it is someone, it starts to ask these kinds
of questions. And this gives just more fuel to the sense of I! It believes it has
some kind of past and it has some kind of future. And so it starts to map out
its live. It starts to dream up its personality, it starts to become somebody.
<span class="pdfpage">206</span>  That has happened to all of us! It’s been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Buddha taught us the way that we can see this process
in action and that we can let it go, remove ourselves from it.</p>
<p>If it’s not in the past and not in the future, it can just be inwardly confused in the present moment. When it doesn’t see things as they are, it starts
to think: «Am I? What am I? Who am I? Where have I come from? Where
am I going? Am I a being?» It starts to think in all these different ways. It
starts to attend unwisely to the present moment in this way. It’s subjectified
to the present moment. A duality has been created. There is a dichotomy in
the world, separation into two halves: the world of me and out there.</p>
<p>When  this  happens  all  kind  of  views  start  to  arise.  Stronger  views.
When  he  attends  unwisely,  these  views  arise  in  him.  «Oh,  it’s  this  self  of
mine that speaks and feels. This self of mine experiences here and now the
results of good and bad actions. This self of mine is really permanent, really
everlasting and not subject to change and it will endure as long as eternity.»
The identity view has become so solid, that the being starts to think of itself
in solid terms. «I mean, I am permanent. All this mind and matter, that stuff
is passing away but the experiencer of it that’s the real self.» That’s the self
with  the  big  «S». That’s  my  true  self,  that’s  what’s  beyond  or  underneath
all the swirling flow of mental and physical phenomena. The view of a big
self arises. A really concrete and solid form. A full blown delusion. In that it
starts to believe that it’s attached and identified with the five aggregates but
then it starts to believe that it is something even beyond the five aggregates.
It has really been infected by a sense of self.</p>
<p>The Buddha says when this happens, when he attends unwisely, these
views arise. He says these views are a speculative view. It’s called the thicket
of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a facilitation of views,
a  fetter  of  views.
<em>«Fettered  by  this  fetter  of  views,  the  untaught  ordinary
person is not freed from birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,</em>
<em>grief and despair. They are not freed from dukkha»</em>, I say.</p>
<p>So identity view is the leash that keeps us bound to existence. It keeps
us bound to this circle of being, of craving to be, wanting to be – of suffering! It’s this identity view, this constant need for recognition, this constant
need that it has for being «me». We spend so much time doing this in our
<span class="pdfpage">207</span>  lives. We create an identity trying to develop an ego. Partly the result of our
family, partly the result of our community and our society structure. Everyone  is  craving  to  be  something.  We  are  taught  it  from  a  very  young  age.
«What are you going to be when you are going to grow up?» In our education system they want us to become something. It’s geared to get trained a
particular thing for a particular task, with a label, with a hat on, with a name
tag. «I’m a doctor, I’m a lawyer, I’m a plumber, carpenter, nurse, teacher,
truck driver, psychiatrist.» We want to be something. When we don’t want,
when we don’t get what we want to be – dukkha! Even worse, if we don’t
know what we want to be, that’s even more confusing. Everyone’s telling us
that we have to be something, that we have to get something, that we have
to become something.
<em>The nature of reality is that we are nothing, and yet</em>
<em>everyone is saying that we have to be something.</em>
There’s a huge gap between
those two things. There’s a cognitive dissonance. Our expectations and our
reality  are  two  different  things.  It’s  no  wonder  that  we  go  crazy  trying  to
think what we have to become. It’s no wonder that we have spent time in
institutions of learning to try to become something. We are not really interested in counting other people’s money, but I want to be an accountant. It’s
the being, we strive and try to become. This the cause of dukkha.</p>
<p>So  identity  view  is  removed  when  we  reach  the  first  path. When  we
arrive  at  the  path  of  the  stream-enterer  or  a
<em>sottapanna</em>. The  first  level  of
enlightenment,  the  first  level  of  awakening.  Where  this  gross  self,  this
identify view is pulled out by the roots and discarded. Wisdom completely
removes it. The sense of self will no longer arise. It is impossible for it to
arise again. Doubt also disappears or that the believe in rights and rituals can
lead to awakening. This wrong view is also removed. Any doubt about what
is the correct way to practice, the noble eightfold path, that’s also done away
with. So identity view, believe in rights and rituals being efficacious leading
to the desired result is thrown away, and also doubt is let go of. These three
fetters are removed at the first path of awakening.</p>
<p>The path of stream entry is reachable in this very life. This is our goal
as  humans  to  enter  the  stream  that  flows  to  nirvana.  If  we  can  go  further
than  that,  even  better.  The  heart  of  our  Vipassana  practice  is  to  note  our
five  aggregates,  to  see  them  clearly  as  impermanent,  dukkha,  dependently
<span class="pdfpage">208</span>  arisen, conditioned, out of control, impersonal processes. Dukkha is finally
removed by contemplating the rise and the fall of the aggregates.</p>
<p><em>«Venerable sir, how does one know and how does one see, so that in
regard to this body with its consciousness and all the external conceptions,
there  is  no  I-making  and  no  mine-making  and  no  underlying  tendency  to
conceit?» – «Well, bikkhu, any kind of material form, any kind of feeling, any
kind of perception, any kind of mental formation, any kind of consciousness
that arises, whether it be past, present or future, whether it be internal or
external, whether it’s gross or subtle, superior or inferior, near or far, one
sees all these five aggregates as they actually are with proper wisdom thus,
this is not mine, this is not I, this is not myself. When he knows and sees thus,
he becomes disenchanted with the five aggregates. Being disenchanted, he
becomes dispassionate. And through dispassion the mind is liberated. When
it  is  liberated,  there  comes  the  knowledge  it  is  liberated.  He  understands
birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done, has been</em>
<em>done. There is no more coming to any state of being.»</em></p>
<p>And this is how we remove dukkha, this is how we contemplate to pull
ourselves out of this conditioned existence and transition into the unconditioned.</p>
