# Day 2, morning



Some may be tired this morning. Many people are, don't worry, you're 
not the only one. Just maintain some awareness of it. Don't become involved 
with  the  state  of  tiredness  otherwise  you  will  start  to  create  some  dukkha 
for yourself. You can just note and know that there's some tiredness there 
without identifying with the tiredness and you can free your mind from that 
particular mind state.

This morning we're going to talk about the sitting meditation again. We 
are going to refine our instructions for the sitting meditation.


## Reflning sitting meditation instructions


Up  until  now  we  have  been  simply  following  the  breath  as  it  enters 
into the nostrils, glides down through the chest, comes to the abdomen, it 
raises,  and  then  the  abdomen  falls  and  it  comes  back  out  again.  We  have 
been following it, in and out, trying to be as continuous as we possibly can. 
Trying to maintain our awareness in the present, internalizing that present 
moment awareness and following the breath. This is the preliminary step of 
just bringing ourselves into the present and trying to connect with the body 
a little bit more. Some of you will have noticed, that the breath doesn't only 
go to the lungs, but travels right down into the abdomen. In fact, the breath 
can seem to flow all the way from the head right down to the toes and back 
 [81]{.pdfpage}  up again. There is a subtle movement of energy inside the body. They call it
*vayo dathu*, the air element. It's moving. The breath is part of this element. 
There are actually quite a few different types of energies flowing through the 
body. Those types of movements that the arms do, those types of movements 
of  digestion  and  clearing  the  bowels  and  the  bladder. All  types  of  movements, the chest expanding and contracting, the abdomen rising and falling, 
the supporting feeling that's coming up from down below and coming up the 
back into the head. These are all characteristics of the air element. Please try 
to follow them for a little bit.

As we start to stabilize our awareness, just on the path of breath sensations, some of you will have noticed that it is a little bit clearer at some 
points with regards to the physical sensations that are occurring. Some will 
have noticed that the sensation is greater around the nostril area, around the 
upper lip. They can connect there a little bit easier. For some people it is in 
the chest or the heart area. For others, it’s in the abdomen area. Lots of sensations are going on here as the abdomen rises and falls.

Now  at  this  point  in  the  retreat,  I'd  like  you  to  choose  one  of  these 
places and maintain your awareness just at that one particular place. So at 
this point we drop the chasing and the following of the breath as it flows in 
and out and we just choose a single place. Some people have already started 
to practice meditation having their awareness in the nostril area. That's fine. 
You can maintain your awareness there, continue to practice in this spot as 
long  as  you're  paying  attention  to  the  touching  sensation  that  is  occurring 
there. Other people will find, that they feel their abdomen rising and falling 
more easily.

For those of you who are new to meditation, who haven’t yet established  a  practice,  all  those  of  you  who  have  tried  different  meditations,  I 
recommend  that  you  try  to  practice  at  the  abdomen.  The  rise  and  fall  of 
the abdomen. At the abdomen we're paying attention almost exclusively to 
the different sensations that are occurring there. The breath doesn't actually 
arrive at the abdomen. There is just movement going in and out. That movement is the air element. The air element will manifest itself in many different ways. Sometimes there will be a pushing and pulling. Sometimes there 
will be a little bit of pressure. Sometimes there is some tension. Sometimes 
 [82]{.pdfpage}  twisting. At other times, it will be vibrating. There is lots of different physical sensations to be aware of at the abdomen. You're not watching the breath 
going in and out. For those of you who have ever cut a piece of wood with a 
saw, we're not looking at the saw as it goes in and out – that's the breath. We 
look at the piece of wood and the little slit, that starts to be made there as we 
run the saw over the wood. That’s where we watch. You're always watching 
just  at  that  spot. We're  much  more  interested  in  the  touching  of  the  wood 
than we are in the metal of the saw. The saw will keep going back and forth. 
The  breath  will  keep  flowing  in  and  flowing  out.  That's  just  a  conceptual 
framework, just a guide to keep us present. What we are interested in here, 
is the touching sensation on the physical body.

The first stage of our satipatthana practice is all about body awareness.
It’s  called
*kaya-nupassana*,  reflection  upon  the  body.  We're  interested  in 
establishing mindfulness on the body. In fact, all meditation systems begin 
with mindfulness of the body. When mindfulness of the body is established, 
we can go on and establish all kinds of different types of meditation.

For those of you who are not going to watch the touching point at the 
nose, I advise that you watch the abdomen as it is rising and falling. Become 
aware of the physical sensations that are there. You need to put your mind 
down  into  the  abdomen. You  will  need  to  keep  it  down  there,  to  stabilize 
it  down  there.  It  will  run  up.  It  comes  up  to  its  old  playground,  the  eyes 
and the ears. It loves to come up and manifest here. That’s where it’s been 
manifesting for most of our lives. Sights and sounds. But we want to try and 
bring our awareness down to the abdomen and become aware right of the 
very beginning, moving through and finishing. And then there's a little gap. 
And then the abdomen falls. So we are paying attention to the movement of 
the abdomen and the sensations created by the movement of the abdomen. 
As long as the object of our mindfulness is either the sensation of touch or 
the sensation created by the movement in the body – our object is a body
object – our practice will lead us to see
*sabhava*, the ultimate reality of the 
four elements.

A little note of warning for those of you who like to practice at the nose 
tip. Sometimes what can happen is that we loose our awareness as our meditation starts to develop. We loose our awareness of the touching sensation 
 [83]{.pdfpage}  and the mind turns toward the breath exclusively. And the breath transforms 
from an object of the body into a conceptual object. We start to watch the 
breath as a concept, as an idea. We start to imagine it as a particular flow, or 
a particular thing, or a tube of breath, or a tube of light or any type of other 
kind of conceptualizations. These manifest as various images, various pictures, lights, all kinds of shapes. This shouldn't be a concern to you. If you 
start to see things in your meditation practice, just make a note of what is 
exactly going on. You're seeing. Seeing is occurring. You're not seeing with 
your physical eye but you’re seeing with your mind. Your mind is starting 
to generate some kind of images. Geometric patterns, colors or lights. Just 
make  a  gentle  note,  ‘seeing,  seeing’.  If  you  become  excited  if  something 
starts happening like that, make a note, ‘excitement, excitement’. We want 
to stay on top of exactly what is happening. We don't want to get stuck. We 
don't want to get involved in the object. We don't want to start identifying 
with the object. We don't want to go into the object. We want to keep stepping back, keep detaching, this is not a meditation where we go in and start 
identifying with the body. This is a meditation practice where we step out 
and stop identifying with what is actually going on in the present moment.

Just a word of warning to you. For those of you who experience lights 
and sounds and colors, when you practice at the nose tip, just make a note. 
‘Seeing’.  Establish  your  awareness  and  wisdom  at  the  same  level  as  your 
concentration.  In  that  way  you  will  be  able  to  balance  the  faculties. And 
Vipassana insight loves the balanced faculties. When the five faculties, faith, 
energy,  mindfulness,  concentration  and  wisdom  are  balanced,  Vipassana 
insight starts to flow. We’ll be talking about balancing the faculties as the 
week goes on.

So for those of you who wish to continue at the nose tip, you can do so. 
But for those of you who are new to meditation, I suggest establishing your 
awareness at the movement of the abdomen.

I strongly suggest that you work it out this morning four yourself. Don't 
become someone who switches between the two places sometimes practicing at the abdomen, sometimes practicing at the nose always creating doubt 
about  where  you  should  follow  the  breath  or  what  you  should  be  doing. 
This is not the type of state that we need to be developing. We don't want to 
 [84]{.pdfpage}  develop uncertainty, doubt within ourselves. We want to be clear about what 
we’re doing. So you need to choose one of these two places and stick with it 
for the rest of the retreat and that will be for your benefit.

The work of unremitting mindfulness and awareness on our breath as it 
arises and passes away, as the physical sensations arise and pass away, will 
lead to certain states of calmness. Quietness occasionally. When we start to 
connect  with  the  breath,  don't  get  carried  away  by  these  beginning  stages 
of meditation. It's also interesting to experience that, but that's not the end 
goal of our meditation. Whilst we are practicing in this way, rising, falling, 
rising, falling, I also want to incorporate a third object into our meditation 
practice. So we are changing quite a lot this morning. We are changing from 
chasing the breath as it’s moving in and out, to establishing the breath at a 
single place.

At the beginning stages of our meditation practice, we come into the 
hall, we sit down, arrange our legs, our hands, our eyes, establish our awareness in the present moment, just the present moment is our object, and then 
after  a  minute  or  so,  we  start  to  internalize  –  you  can  start  to  internalize 
before  the  minute  is  up  if  you  like  –  just  start  to  internalize  that  awareness keeping your mind deep inside the body. And when it runs up through 
another door, through a sound or through a thought, just gently bring it back. 
Don't scold yourself but just bring it back. You have to be quite firm in the 
training  of  your  mind.  You  can’t  allow  it  to  be  slack  anytime  during  the 
week. You will have to firmly decide, this is what you're going to be doing 
here and work towards that goal. It's no good working a little bit and then 
resting a little bit. That doesn't really work. You can do that for many years 
and still the practice will not be successful. So I encourage you to work consistently and persistently.

When we’re watching the rise and fall of the abdomen, as it rises, we 
make a note from the beginning until the end of the physical sensation. So 
we are aware when it starts, we follow the sensation through till it finishes. 
And then the abdomen will start to fall. We’re aware of the beginning of the 
sensation,  following  it  through  and  then  it  finishes. At  the  end  of  the  outbreath, in, out, there will be a little gap there. In that gap, I want you to turn 
your attention, or focus your awareness, to the sensation of the whole body 
 [85]{.pdfpage}  as it is sitting there. Just for a snap second. Just for that little gap between the 
out-breath and the in-breath. So it goes something like this: ‘rising, falling, 
sitting’. We become aware of the whole sitting posture. And then: ‘rising, 
falling,  sitting.  Rising,  falling,  sitting’.  So  we  are  moving  our  awareness 
from the place here in the center of the body, where the sensations are strong 
– the vibrations are strong, the heat is strong, the movement is strong, the 
sensations are manifesting very well to observe at this location, as it rises 
and falls, we're keeping our attention right here. As soon as the out-breath 
is finished, I want you to broaden your awareness, and become aware of the 
whole  body.  Become  aware  of  the  head  and  shoulders,  down  through  the 
legs, just the whole thing. Try to capture the single sensation that is existing 
between  the  end  of  the  out-breath  and  the  beginning  of  the  in-breath.  So: 
‘rising,  falling,  sitting’.  What's  there?  Try  to  activate  your  awareness  and 
catch the whole body. This will continue to keep us in the present moment 
and  it'll  continue  to  internalize  our  awareness.  In  fact,  the  rising  and  the 
falling  keeps  us  present  and  the  internalization  on  the  physical  sensation 
keeps us internalized. So we are trying to make it continuous by doing this 
over and over again ‘rising, falling, sitting, rising, falling, sitting’. This is 
not a new object. We’ve been doing it at the start of the meditation sessions 
already. The  second  minute  of  the  sittings  have  been  present  moment  and 
then internalizing. Try to take a snapshot of the sensation in the whole body. 
We’re not trying to create an image of the body. We’re not trying to imagine 
what we look like sitting on the mat. We're just trying to experience: what is 
it now that you can feel?

What  can  you  experience?  Hardness,  softness,  warmth,  coolness, 
vibrations, tingling…capture the physical sensation that is occurring in the 
present moment right at the point between the out-breath and the in-breath. 
Become aware of the whole body as it is sitting there just for a second at the 
end of the out-breath. ‘Rising, falling, sitting, rising, falling, sitting, rising, 
falling,  sitting,  rising,  falling,  sitting’.  So  this  becomes  your  new  main 
object. Do this 80-90% of the time! Going around in this sequence trying to 
make it continuous. Trying to follow from beginning to end.

The snapshot has to be quick. In the beginning stages you may not be 
able  to  capture  the  sensation  of  the  whole  body.  Don't  let  that  worry  you. 
 [86]{.pdfpage}  Avert your awareness to the whole sitting posture and then come back to the 
breath. The more time you do it, the clearer it will become. Don't spend your 
time trying to search for it at the beginning, this will disturb your breath! It's 
very quick. It’s very short, as fast as your iPhone can take a photo. And then 
back to the breathing again. ‘Rising, falling, sitting, rising, falling, sitting, 
rising, falling, sitting’. We keep going around and around in this way.

For  those  of  you  who  have  been  here  before,  you  can  even  add  the 
fourth object. Be aware that sometimes it can be a little bit busy for beginners doing the three stage sitting meditation before you're going to the fourth. 
You can also become aware of the touching of the body on the mat. This is 
a  fourth  object.  ‘Rising,  falling,  sitting,  touching’.  Touching  is  the  sensation of the body sitting on the mat. It's quite different from sitting. Sitting is 
the sensation of the whole body as a posture. Touching is a particular part, 
whether it’s your butt-cheeks or your knees or your ankles. I propose that 
you  go  from  butt-cheek  to  butt-cheek.  ‘Rising,  falling,  sitting,  touching’. 
Feel that cheek sitting on the mat. There is a touching sensation there. And 
then: ‘Rising, falling, sitting, touching’. On the left side. ‘Rising, falling, sitting, touching’. On the right side. [or: ‘rising, falling, sitting, touching left, 
touching right’].

This  will  do  many  things  for  your  meditation  practice.  Most  importantly it will increase the amount of energy that we are using. Normally we 
breath about 12 times every minute. That is 12 times in and 12 times out. 
If we're only noting the breath, we’ll spend a whole minute to just note 24 
times. It's not really fast enough. It's not really continuous enough for our 
insight  to  break  through. We  add  a  few  extra  objects  so  that  we  can  keep 
the mind busy and engaged with being in the present moment. If we only 
have two, we will find ourselves getting nice and comfortable and pleasant 
and  then  a  kind  of  pleasant  dullness  comes  upon  us.  It's  kind  of  nice  but 
nothing  really  happens.  Our  meditation  comes  to  a  kind  of  plateau.  Many 
people experience this. If we add an extra object, not only are we doing it 
24 times a minute, now we have added 12 extra objects. We're doing it 36 
times a minute. So we need to use a lot more energy and effort to activate 
our awareness in the present moment. We are increasing our workflow by 
50%.  It's  very  effective  in  maintaining  our  awareness  continuously. You'll 
 [87]{.pdfpage}  will find yourself becoming closer and closer, further and further, deeper and 
deeper into the body. You will be able to stay inside. For those of you whose 
mind is wandering in the past and future, you will also find, if you're paying 
attention to more objects, then your mind will have less time to go wandering. You won't get distracted. It takes a lot of effort to be continuously aware 
in  this  way.  ‘Rising,  falling,  sitting,  touching’. About  that  pace.  We  don't 
interrupt the breath. So we keep going around and around that way. You may 
have to put your hand on the abdomen or you may have to take a couple of 
deep  breaths  to  be  able  to  find  that  sensation  of  movement. Take  three  or 
four deep breaths and then allow the breath to come to its natural breathing.
Do not neglect the first and second stages of the practice. Don't come to 
the hall and try to immediately start to watch your breath. You should establish your awareness in the present and spend a minute doing that. Establish 
your awareness internally. Spend a minute doing that. It's important that you 
do this, so that the mind has time to calm down before we start watching the 
breath. We allow the breath just a couple of minutes to calm down and get to 
its natural state. We want it to be as natural as possible. We don't want to be 
manipulating the breath in any way. Sometimes it will feel it is impossible 
to not manipulate the breath. And that’s ok. Just try not to do it very much. 
The breath has an intentional structure. So it is a little bit under the control 
of consciousness but most of the time we want it to be completely natural. So 
try to allow the breath to establish its natural rhythm at the beginning before 
we start to observe it.

So in this way, we start to use this as our main object. ‘Rising, falling, 
sitting,  touching.  Rising,  falling,  sitting,  touching’.  Over  and  over  again. 
Keep your mind in the present. Internalizing keep doing this. Keep circling 
around and around. If your mind starts to wander and you think of the past, 
make a note, ‘thinking’. Or ‘remembering’. And then quickly come back to
the ‘rising, falling, sitting, touching’.
*Our main object needs to be followed 
as  much  as  we  can.  We  only  note  the  secondary  objects,  such  as  hearing,*
*when  they're  actually  disturbing  the  practice*,  when  they  actually  come  in 
into our cycling of the rising, falling, sitting, touching.

Some of you want to use the fourth object. You can use hearing. I find 
this also very useful to bring myself back to the present moment. Hearing is 
 [88]{.pdfpage}  an object which is always available. It's always there. The ears are always 
hearing. We can't turn them off. It's a continuous object. It's there. Of course, 
we are not always paying attention to it. But in our meditation practice we 
can use it, we can note hearing whenever it interferes our practice. Or we can 
incorporate hearing into our Vipassana. In that way you can do it like this: 
‘rising, falling, sitting, hearing. Rising, falling, sitting, hearing. Rising, falling, sitting, hearing’. You keep your awareness at the center of the body. In 
and out. Then you broaden your awareness. And then you bring it to the ears. 
And then you bring it back down again. So you're moving your awareness 
around inside your body. You’re following where consciousness, the bowl, 
is arising and you’re noting what’s in the bowl. Mostly we're noting physical sensations. When we’re doing ‘rising, falling, sitting, touching’, we’re 
noting all the physical sensations. This is all body objects. This is all rupa. 
It’s all the four elements.

So try to let go of the conceptual idea of a body. Try to let go of the 
conceptual idea of breath. Tune your mind, tune your awareness to just be 
interested in physical sensations. Turn off the picture that you have of your 
body or your ideas that you have about the breath. Try to be aware of just 
what is exactly there without you painting your ideas on top of it. We want 
to get back to nature. We want to strip away the conceptual world and come 
back and visit what is actually going on in the body. This is the main part of 
our practicing in the beginning stages. We are paying attention to the body. 
We’re paying attention in particular to the postures. Walking, standing, sitting and lying down. During our daily activities we are trying to keep ourselves aware of whatever posture we’re in from moment to moment. We're 
continuously  aware  and  knowing  that  now  it’s  sitting.  Continuing  to  sit. 
Now it’s standing up. Now it’s walking. Now it’s standing. Just try to keep 
your awareness in the present. Keep it inside and maintain it during the daily 
activities.

During  the  sitting  and  the  walking  meditation  we  use  the  posture  as 
well but we're also paying attention to the physical sensations. It's really two 
kinds of objects that we use for becoming aware of the body.

Different people will break through in slightly different ways. We pay 
attention to the postures and the body sensations.

- [89]{.pdfpage} Those of us who are more inclined to watching the breath as it arises 
   and passes, arises and passes, we are turning into the general characteristic of
   *anicca*
   or impermanence. Seeing things arise and pass away, 
   arise and pass away.

- Those connecting with the bodily postures (the walking, sitting, lying 
   down) you will start to become aware of the general characteristics of
   *dukkha*
   . You start to see that things are not so wonderful as you thought 
   they were. Just a relatively speaking. There is some suffering going on.

- Those who manage to penetrate through the characteristics of the four
   elements, will start to become aware of the characteristic of
   *anata*
   or 
   non-self. There will be no self that's arising. You will see that this thing 
   sitting  here,  is  just  a  bag  of  physical  sensations,  without  a  bag.  It  is 
   a  field  of  physical  sensations.  We  painted  it,  that  it  is  a  body,  arms, 
   legs, head, as me, as mine – these are just concepts! They don't exist 
   in the ultimate reality. They are man made inventions, which we have 
   decided to call a body, an arm, a leg. And in your language you may 
   have another word for it. This is just conceptual, this is not reality. Our 
   Vipassana will go further than the conceptual and penetrate deeply to 
   see the ultimate realities. We want to understand the nature of earth, 
   water, fire and air.

We  want  to  see  the  nature  of  rupa,  matter.  When  we  see  matter,  by 
default  we  will  also  see  the  nature  of  the  mind.  It’s  immaterial,  the  mind 
has no physicality to it. We can’t know the mind by seeing it. We know it's 
knowing and we know it’s power. It is energy. We can develop many different mind states, so that we can know rupa. Rupa does not know anything. It's 
kind of dumb. Earth, water, fire and air – it's a lump of stuff sitting there on 
the mat. It’s breathing in and out. Physical sensations are occurring. The four 
elements are balancing or unbalancing with each other as the day goes on. 
Sometimes it’s warm, sometimes it becomes hard, sometimes it’s vibrating. 
Physical sensations manifesting throughout the body.

The sitting posture will reveal its own set of characteristics. When we 
avert  to  the  sitting,  I  want  you  to  try  to  grab  the  most  obvious  sensation 
that's there. If you can't yet feel the supporting – there is kind of a flow that’s 
coming up from underneath supporting the body, it's natural floating there 
 [90]{.pdfpage}  all the time – if you pull your mind inside, you’ll be able to experience this 
supporting  sensation. There's  also  vibrations. There's  also  the  temperature 
aspect. There's also just the aspect of the sitting posture.

I would like you all to do the three or four stage sitting meditation. It 
will be busy – because it is busy – but it will be very beneficial. With this 
extra  work,  the  mind  has  no  time  to  wander,  go  thinking  or  planing.  We 
sharpen our aim with directing consciousness – we are using awareness and 
wisdom to direct our consciousness – to the place where the physical sensation is most clear. And we are following it. From beginning to end. And 
then we’re broadening our awareness capturing the whole body. Then we’re 
coming  back  in  again.  Keep  circulating,  keep  looping  around  and  around. 
Don't worry if it is not clear for a first few minutes, just keep doing the work 
and then the mind will follow and start to know what to do. It understands 
during the breath it needs to be here. At the end of the breath it becomes wide 
and takes in the whole body. You train the mind with various objects. Like 
going to the gym.

Make sure, there are no gaps during the noting process! From beginning to end, from beginning to end. If you become aware – and you don’t 
have to search for these sensations, but if you become aware of some vibration, if that’s the predominant sensation, make a note ‘vibrating, vibrating’. 
Try to make that an objective object. So we can step back from it and stop 
identifying with it. If there is some pressure, or if you feel some pushing, 
make a note of that. ‘Pressure, pressure’. ‘Pushing, pushing’. If you feel it's 
kind of twisting. Make a note of that. If we can already follow the breath as 
it comes out, in, it starts to penetrate, it starts to go in into each other. The 
mind and the object become very close to each other. They come very close 
right up in your face, in your awareness, in your consciousness.

Whatever is the predominant sensation, must be observed and noticed. 
We  should  spend  80  or  90%  of  our  time  doing  this  rising,  falling,  sitting, 
touching, rising, falling, sitting, touching. If you want to do the fourth object: 
rising, falling, sitting, hearing, rising, falling, sitting, hearing, rising, falling, 
sitting,  touching,  rising,  falling,  sitting,  touching. You  keep  going  around 
and around like that. Only noting the other external objects when they come 
to interfere with our cycling. Only when they interfere. We want to stay as 
 [91]{.pdfpage}  much as we can with the main object, as much as we can in the present, as 
much as we can internalizing.

In the first two days, when you’re a little bit tired, you will find this 
kind of hard work. For the first few days you're doing it and no results are 
occurring. But what we're doing is putting the conditions in place for insight 
to unfold.

This  is  how  we  practice  with  the  body  door. This  afternoon  we  will 
go into examining feeling, the first object of the mental door. But first we’ll 
stick with the body.

Also  whilst  we're  practicing  in  this  way,  during  the  walking  meditation, you can become aware of the arising of various sense consciousnesses. 
Sense consciousness arises at the eye door, the ear door, the nose door, the 
tongue door and the body door. It's very impermanent. It arises for a fraction 
of a second and then it passes away.

As our Vipassana practice develops, we are going to go through four 
foundations of mindfulness. We are going to look at the physical sensations, 
which we have been talking about for the last few days. We're going to look 
at  feeling  which  is  either  pleasant  or  unpleasant.  We  are  going  to  look  at 
various mind states. The state of mind with greed or hatred or delusion. And 
we are also going to be looking at various reactions and thought processes 
that we may have. So there are four foundations of mindfulness to establish 
our  awareness  in  the  present  moment,  to  block  craving  from  being  from 
entering. And we'll be going through these as the week goes on.


## True Vipassana technique


When we are paying attention to the rising, the falling and the sitting, 
sense  consciousnesses  will  be  activated.  Sometimes  we  will  hear  things. 
We’ll start seeing things or smelling things. These sense consciousnesses are 
arising and passing away. You can make a note of them. In fact, true Vipassana practice includes all six doors. We note and know them as they arise and 
pass away at the six doors. As my old teacher used to say, note it, know it and 
let it go. Whatever is arising. The instructions this morning have been for the 
body door. That's just one of the doors. We are just paying attention to the 
body, its posture and its sensations. But the other doors are also opening and 
 [92]{.pdfpage}  closing continuously. So we'll need to start to become aware of them as well. 
In the beginning, we start with a selected small group of things to train the 
mind on. The rising, the falling, the sitting, the touching, the hearing. This
is a select group so that we can start to train the mind to be present [
*directed*
*awareness*
]. As our practice develops, we start to let go of this selected group 
of meditation objects and our awareness opens up and becomes choiceless
[
*choiceless awareness*
]. We start to watch whatever is arising, whenever it 
is arising at the eye door, the ear, nose, tongue and body doors and the mind 
door as well. Once we’ve established a certain level of stability in the mind, 
once  our  awareness  and  wisdom  have  become  concentrated  or  stabilized, 
then you will be able to bounce between the various doors.

For the beginning stage, we try to stay at the main object as much as 
possible, as I said. If any of these other doors are activated, you can quickly 
note them and come back. When our practice is fully developed, we won't 
need to stick with the rising, falling, sitting. We will be able to be aware in 
the present moment to whatever is going on. Arising and passing away.

So  we  try  to  maintain  our  awareness  on  the  main  object,  but  for  the 
sake  of  completeness,  the  body  and  mind  receives  all  its  information  into 
through these six doors moment after moment. One door opens and closes, 
another  door  opens  and  closes.  Consciousness  can  only  arise  in  one  location. And then it passes away. It does so very rapidly, so that we build up a 
perception of the world. We hear the dog barking and see the dog, maybe 
through two doors (hearing, seeing) or three doors (with smelling), then our 
mind goes through our recognition system, our perception, we recognize it 
as a dog. We have seen it and we can smell it and we can hear it. So we paint 
a picture of what it actually is. A conceptual view of what is actually there. 
When we start to do this, that means our mind is going out into the story of 
that barking. It's going out through the eye door.

What we want to be able to do is to maintain our awareness internally 
and allow consciousness to arise and pass away, arise and pass away, arise 
and  pass  away  with  us  just  observing,  just  witnessing  what  is  going  on. 
We’re not going into the story. We are stepping back from the story. When 
there is a sound outside and you have an ear, ear consciousness arises. When 
there is a visible form and you have some eyes, eye consciousness arises. 
 [93]{.pdfpage}  When you have a nose and there is a scent, nose consciousness arises. We 
normally call this hearing, seeing and smelling. I want you to make a note 
when you notice that the body has been activated in this way. If you notice 
that the eye door has been activated, make a note, seeing. Don't get stuck 
in  what  you  are  seeing.  That  is  called  looking,  watching.  You  have  gone 
through the door and you’ve gone to the object and you're starting to play 
with it. You have become engaged with it. So our meditation practice is to 
come inside, to notice that one of the sense doors has been triggered and just 
make a note. Seeing is occurring. This unit is sitting here, its eyes are open, 
seeing is occurring. Hearing is occurring. Smelling is occurring. There is a 
physical sensation of touching, touching is occurring. Sometimes it’s going 
into  the  past,  remembering  is  occurring.  Sometimes  it  goes  to  the  future. 
Planning is occurring. This is what we want to get down and note. We are 
not interested in the content of what we are hearing and seeing. We don't care 
if it's a yellow dog or white dog. Or a brown dog, or a tree, or a rock. We’re 
not interested in what we are seeing. We are interested in the fact that seeing 
is occurring. We're not interested in that someone's T-shirt is pink or green. 
If we are noticing details like that, that means we're going out through the 
doors. We don't make a note green or pink or whatever, T-shirt or person. 
We're not making a note like that. We're coming back before that starts to be 
identified with. We’re coming back if we note, «oh, the process of seeing is 
occurring and finishes». «Oh, hearing is occurring.» Finished. Smelling. It’s 
finished. Rising, falling is occurring. Hearing again. Planning. Future.

The  six  doors  are  opening  and  closing  continuously  throughout  the 
day. If we are unmindful of them, each of those events will be subjectified. 
Each of those events will be appropriated and identified with either as me, 
mine, I or some variation of that ego experience. But if our awareness and 
wisdom is able to note and know, if we’re able to keep up with the doors 
as they arise and pass away, we won’t go into the stories of the content. We 
won’t start to identify with the story and pictures and ideas, that we create 
when we see and hear and smell and taste things. We will be able to be very 
present and aware and able to see exactly what is going on. This body does 
see things, does hear things. There are physical sensations going on. These 
are our objects. Don't think of physical pain as stopping you from meditation. [94]{.pdfpage}  That pain is the object of the present moment. That wandering mind is 
the object of the present moment. So it doesn't matter whether you can keep 
your mind continuously with the breath – of course, it's preferred. Of course, 
that’s what we’re trying to do, what we're aiming for – but if your mind is 
wandering for the first few days of practice, or the physical sensations, the 
numbness, the sore back, or the tiredness, whatever your experience is in the 
present moment, that can also be an object of our meditation. What we’re 
most  importantly  doing,  is  turning  our  experience,  our  life,  into  a  field  of 
objects. And  we’re  stepping  back  from  those  fields  of  objects  so  that  we 
can see them just arising and passing away without becoming involved with 
them, without identifying with them. When we see in this way, it’s called 
clear seeing – Vipassana.

We have to see the physical objects, we have to see the mental objects, 
we have to see causes and effects and linkages between these two, and if we 
can practice in real time with this real data – things that are actually occurring  in  the  present  moment  –  then  we  will  break  through  and  stop  seeing 
the individual characteristics of each event and we’ll start to see the general 
characteristics  inherent  in  all  conditioned  phenomena. All  the  phenomena 
arising and passing away at the six sense doors are impermanent. All phenomena are suffering, when it’s identified with. And all phenomena is nonself,  it’s  out  of  control.  It's  not  happening  to  anyone.  It's  just  happening. 
There's no see-er, but there is seeing occurring. There's no hear-er, but there 
is hearing occurring. Physical sensations are occurring in the body, but they 
are not yours. They don't belong to you. If you identify with them – suffering 
will be your friend.

You have a physical pain in the body and you identify with it, it gives 
you suffering. If you don’t identify with it and see it clearly for what it actually is, it doesn't give you any suffering! It is just a physical sensation, it's 
just a mental state. If we become sad for example, if we identify with the 
sadness and start to think, «oh, I am sad, I am unhappy, I am depressed, I am 
worried», we will give ourselves suffering. If we can step back from it, note 
it, know it and let it go, then we’ve stopped identifying with it. That sadness 
may still be there, but it doesn't cause any dukkha. It doesn't give us any suffering because it doesn't belong to us. We haven’t accepted it. – So we step 
 [95]{.pdfpage}  away from that stuff.

For the moment we’re doing it with the physical sensations, but we'll 
start to move to the other doors as well. We observe the knowing that’s arising in the present moment. As Ajahn Sumedo says: «The practice is, now is 
the knowing.» This is the state of the mind when it's just knowing what is 
arising and passing away in the present moment. Have a think about that! 
Now is the knowing. We are just knowing whatever is there without getting 
involved in it. When we don't get involved, it passes away and then a new 
object arises. We don't get involved, it passes away and then a new object 
arises. And a new object arises. If we can do this effectively and efficiently, 
this  process  will  become  extremely  rapid. We  will  start  to  see  things  in  a 
very radically different way. It kind of looks like it's all so solid and happening. That’s because we're identifying with the objects of our consciousness. For long periods of time. For days and years, we have been identifying 
with our body, with our emotional states. We have been identifying with our 
reactions and judgments, with our views and opinions. Until they stay for a 
while. We don’t really get to see them passing so rapidly. But when we disconnect it and step back, when we put the car in neutral, and, yes, we are still 
rolling down the hill. There is still the rising and passing away but we are 
detached. Dispassionate towards what is going on. We’re starting to let go of 
things. Meditation is the practice of letting go. So we increase our focus on 
letting go to sense doors.

Don't get trapped in sense doors! Don't get trapped in sight and sounds. 
Don’t start delighting! We are not doing the walking meditation to look to 
the jungle or look at other people’s bodies. Don’t allow the mind to go out 
during the food time. When you sit there just be objective and aware that 
you’re putting food into your head that's being chewed. Watch the lower jaw 
as it goes up and down. Then there is some swallowing. There is some tasting occurring. There may be some pleasantness, some liking. These things 
are all going on. But don’t get absorbed into them, especially into your own 
thoughts, into your own emotional states. Stop identifying with them.

If you are feeling tired and lazy, recognize tiredness is there. Laziness 
is there. Try to disconnect from it. Don't identify with it. When you can do 
that, the tiredness will be there, but it won’t be unpleasant and you won't be 
 [96]{.pdfpage}  affected by it. It'll just be there as an object. As soon as it is seen clearly, then 
it can no longer form a base for the sense of self. The object has been seen 
clearly. You will not identify with that. It cannot be a base of me, mine and I. 
It cannot be a base of self. So there is cessation in that moment.

You only need to do that continuously. Object after object. Of course, 
we will miss a few and we note a few. We will get stuck in some old thought 
patterns. Then they start to come up. We will get stuck in them. Try to pull 
yourself out as quickly as possible.

If you are starting having conversations with yourself or with others, 
imaginary conversations, stop that as quickly as you can. If you notice you're 
having a conversation with yourself, ‘talking, talking’. ‘Madness, madness’. 
Just be aware that there is some delight in that conversation. Even though 
you want to be meditating, «I just think to the end of this one. Just allow 
me to think a little bit more and I will just get to the end of this one.» Stop 
it quickly! Train your mind to stop that from going into the content. Come 
back and observe the structure. The content will take us away. The content 
has led us on a wild goose chase. Our whole lives! The content we’re following around, we're chasing after craving’s desires, wishes and wants, we are 
following that. So now is the time to just drop that. «Well, it started thinking.»  ‘Thinking’.  «Conversing.»  ‘Conversing’.  «Thinking  again.»  ‘Thinking’. «Again.» ‘Thinking. Thinking’. And then come back to your rising and 
falling.  ‘Rising,  falling.  Rising,  falling.  Thinking.  Rising,  falling.  Sitting. 
Remembering’.

When you're thinking this over and over again, this is not meditation. 
You're  wasting  your  time. You  are  allowing  your  mind  to  get  absorbed  in 
the object. We don't want to get stuck in the object. There is your thoughts, 
your past, your future, the sound of coughing, the sound of dogs, the sound 
of insects. Whether it's the sights of the jungle or other people. Don't allow 
yourself to go into your judging mind or your comparing mind or your liking 
mind or your disliking mind. Don't go into the story! Vipassana practice is 
all about stepping out of the story. It's about detaching. We are detaching, 
turning, transforming our fast flowing experience into a field of objects that 
can be noted, known and let go. Noting, knowing, letting go. Noting, knowing, letting go. When you do this continuously, object after object, your mind 
 [97]{.pdfpage}  will  fall  into  a  nice  state  of  freedom,  of  detachment,  a  state  of  dispassion 
where you won't find any of the content of the dependently arisen, conditioned phenomena of the mind and body. They no longer hold any interest 
for you. You will have seen through them, through the magic show that the 
mind presents to us. You will be able to let it go. You will be able to live 
freely. You won't be a slave of your emotional states for your own thought 
reaction patterns. You can break out of your reaction patterns. You can break 
out of emotional states that you have been experiencing for a long time. It's 
quite  possible.  In  fact,  people  have  been  doing  it  for  26  centuries. This  is 
how we get a happy and peaceful life. When we step back from the noise and 
the nonsense of the mind, step back and have a look at that stuff, the mind 
won’t become interested in it at all. It sees it only as objects for the arising 
of self. It's just a continuous show of me, mine, I, this is for me, that's not for 
me, that's mine, identifying with stuff, identifying with the emotional states, 
identifying with everything. Creating a dichotomy in the world, a duality, a 
separation from everything else. When our Vipassana practice is successful, 
when  we’ve  managed  to  remove  this  sense  of  I  from  our  experience,  we 
go back to nature, we go back to what the Buddha called dhamma. We’ve 
experienced dhamma for ourselves. We’ve experienced the truth. We don't 
need anybody to tell us what the truth is. We don't have to believe anybody, 
because we have experienced it for ourselves. There is a state of calmness, 
coolness  and  peacefulness  watching  this  never  ending  flow  of  mental  and 
physical phenomena. It's all conditioned and dependently arisen. It doesn't 
belong  to  you.  It's  old  karma  manifesting  from  the  past. When  the  conditions are right, that old karma can manifest. We are then reacting to it. We’re 
engaging in it, we're involving ourselves with it creating fresh karma, which 
there goes and gets recycled again. Our experience is the manifestation of 
our old intentions and our reactions to that, our creation of new karma, which 
is going on all the time if we are unaware. Of course, with mindfulness and 
wisdom in the present moment, we can stop this process from happening. We 
kind of short-circuit it. And we can free ourselves from the mind.

Just a little exercise, when you go to the viewpoint. Be still and aware 
and watch the six sense doors opening and closing. Don't get stuck in the 
content. We don't want to know what we are smelling but only that smelling 
 [98]{.pdfpage}  is occurring. Smell consciousness is arising in the present moment. That's 
our experience right now. That's our experience of eating right now. Tasting 
is  occurring.  Hearing  is  occurring. And  then  it  passes  away.  It  arises  and 
passes away. So go to the viewpoint and just rapidly note ‘hearing, seeing, 
touching, hearing, seeing, touching, smelling,…’ try to bounce between the 
doors without getting into the content. See how far you can go with it. See 
how fast you can note it.

The faster you note it, the bigger the gap becomes, the greater the space 
created around the object. If your noting is kind of slow and sporadically, 
sometimes you note and sometimes you don’t, then you will be opening a 
little gap and then closing again. Opening a little gap and closing again. But 
if you can note consistently and continuously, you'll open the gap until eventually it stays open for quite some time and you will start to experience the 
arising and passing away of mental and physical phenomena independent of 
desire. You’ll see it in the present moment. And that is accompanied with a 
great deal of bliss, a great deal of happiness.

Now  we'll  practice  some  walking  mediation.  As  far  as  the  walking 
meditation is concerned, for those of you who would like to increase their 
walking  meditation  you  can  as  well. You  can  also  increase  to  four  stages. 
‘Lifting, rising, moving, placing’. Four steps. ‘Lifting, rising, moving, placing’. Four stages just like in our sitting meditation! ‘Rising, falling, sitting, 
touching’.  Do  you  see  the  similarity? We’re  using  a  structure  to  train  our 
awareness in the present moment.

I  also  suggested  that  you  stand  still  in  one  spot  and  just  move  your 
foot back and forth at least five or 10 times each foot, so that we get used 
to the sensation on the sole of the foot. It’s the sensation on the sole of the 
foot that we're following here. You should not have an image of your foot in 
your mind, you should not look at your foot. These are all conceptual things.
*We want our meditation to break through to ultimate reality. So we are only*
*paying  attention  to  the  physical  sensations  in  these  for  stages.*
There  are 
different  sensations  in  each  stage. When  you  lift  the  foot  up,  what  is  that 
sensation  lifting  up?  Is  it  heavy  or  does  it  feel  light?  When  we  place  the 
foot down, what does that feel like? Is it heavy or does it feel light? You can 
investigate that for yourself.
