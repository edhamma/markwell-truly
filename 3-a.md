# Morning Talk



Day  three  is  sometimes  characterized  as  being  a  difficult  day.  But  I 
often feel that the first and second days are more difficult myself. You will be 
feeling very tired. You will be feeling quite exhausted. Don’t start following 
your thoughts or getting trapped in your thinking, in your own whispering 
mind. Of course it's challenging. Everyone is facing their own challenges. It 
won't be long before you can pull yourself out of these mind state. It's what 
we are here for. We are training to pull ourself out of difficult mind states 
such as stress, worry, anguish. We are learning how to come out of it. If we 
never  learn  how  to  come  out  of  that  through  meditation,  then  you  always 
come out of your mind states using something else. Wether it be some kind 
of sensuality or some kind of distraction, some kind of technology or whatever it may be. So why not use our own mind, our awareness and wisdom to 
pull us out of these mind states?

This  morning  we  are  going  to  talk  about  the  five  hindrances  or  the
*panca  nivarana*.  These  are  mind  states  which  are  contained  in  the  fourth
section  of  the  satipatthana  text,  in  the  section  called
*dhamma-nupassana*
or  recollection  of  mind  objects. These  are  thought  processes  that  are  arising  and  passing  away.  The  Buddha  asked  us  to  observe  them,  to  become 
aware of them, to fully understand them. To say these five hindrances are an 
impediment to our meditation would be an understatement. They do disturb 
 [114]{.pdfpage}  our practice. They make it difficult to do the mediation practice, however, 
these mental states are also an important vehicle for insight. You can learn a 
lot about the nature of the mind through observing your reactions and your 
thought patterns to things.

We can temporarily overcome these hindrances in our meditation practice, but they are only fully removed at the noble eightfold path. When we 
reach  the  level  of  stream  entry,  some  of  the  hindrances  will  be  cut  off,  in 
particular doubt will be cut off.

Turning our attention to these hindrances at the time of a meditation 
retreat can sometimes be a little bit late. These hindrances are always arising in our mind. They're always there. In fact, they are much of our mental 
life which is spent floating around in those hindrances. It’s because of these 
hindrances that our mind does not become concentrated at deeper levels of 
samadhi.  Because  these  hindrances  are  always  getting  in  our  way,  they're 
always blocking us, always disturbing our meditation development.

So what we will be doing here is identifying these mental states. You 
will all be experiencing one or two of the hindrances or unfortunately maybe 
five of the hindrances. Listen to them and see if you can identify these mental
states going on and see if they're causing you any problem.
*We just need to 
note them, know and let them go! The same technique is prescribed to the*
*mental objects and to mental states.*
They are constantly with us, these five 
hindrances. The five hindrances are constantly coming to disturb us.

The five hindrances are legitimate objects of our satipatthana practice. 
They are presently arising, they are dependently arisen, conditioned and they 
are impermanent and they are unsatisfactory and they are impersonal. They 
don’t belong to anyone. So see if you can notice these defilements. These 
five hindrances are types of defilements, types of imperfections of the mind 
that  come  to  cloud  the  mind  in  their  own  way  so  that  the  mind  can’t  see 
things clearly. They kind of get in the way by the five hindrances attacking 
the mind.

So in our meditation practice we need to keep alert, be aware. If you 
find  that  you  are  being  attacked  by  one  of  these  five  hindrances,  you  will 
need to address the problem. You will need to have a close look at it, make 
a note of which hindrance is occurring and try to step away from it. Try to 
 [115]{.pdfpage}  disconnect or disengage from the mental state. It will still be there, it may 
have some unpleasantness or it may have some pleasantness associated with 
it. Try to step away, stop engaging with that particular state. Watch it pass 
away. Watch it dissolve under the light of awareness and wisdom.

There's a wonderful quote the Buddha gives us.
*«Whatever a bikkhu 
frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his*
*mind.»*
Whatever we think about, in the way we are thinking whilst we are 
thinking, we are actually conditioning our own mind until we become that 
person! If we are constantly getting frustrated and agitated, constantly developing little states of aversion all the time, then chances are we are developing that and that we turn into that person. We are going to turn into an angry 
person! We're  going  to  turn  into  a  person  with  a  lot  of  issues  about  other 
people or other things. So be aware of this tendency, be aware of this conditioning process. Whatever you frequently think and ponder upon, that will 
become the inclination of your mind. So be very careful!

If you constantly worry about things, you are conditioning your mind 
to be in a state of fear and then you become that person. You start to live that 
reality because you have been conditioning your mind. Frequently thinking 
and pondering upon. Every moment you're conditioning. So be very careful 
with what kind of thoughts you start to condition the mind with, because that 
is what you end up as. That is the reality you start to live.

If you noticed that you have come under the sway of a hindrance, don’t 
feed  it  with  any  more  thoughts  about  it.  We  are  not  here  to  continuously 
think  about  things.  Thinking  is  not  meditation.  Thinking  feeds  the  mind 
states. Just like the dog that comes to visit your house. If you feed it, it is 
likely to come back the next day. If you feed it again, it will come back and 
end up sleeping on your couch. That's what happens when we start to feed 
things. They come back and they become part of the furniture. They become 
part of our experience of life. So be careful with these five hindrances.

*These are the five things you need to let go in order to enter jhana, to*
*enter the states of samadhi, necessary for unfolding insight.*
You will need 
to  remove  these.  We  don't  try  and  push  them  away.  This  is  important  to 
remember. We are not trying to push away anything or get rid of anything. 
We are not trying to get anything, or to become anything. We are checking 
 [116]{.pdfpage}  our attitude in how we are meditating and we are just observing whatever is 
there. We are just accepting that it is there. We may not like it, but we accept 
it as this present moment experience contained with this. That’s what’s there. 
You accept it for what it is. You note it's there, you disengage from it, step 
back from it and just let it go. It drops by itself as soon as you’ve disengaged 
from it.

These five hindrances are very habitual states of mind. They are constantly  coming  back  and  we  are  constantly  reacting  in  the  same  way  to 
things. It becomes a habit. We start to condition ourselves with things. If you 
don’t like tomato sauce, you start to condition yourself and will never like 
it. As far as our mind is concerned we are just reacting. We’ve developed a 
pattern of disliking. Whenever we see a bottle of tomato sauce, we avoid it. 
If someone puts tomato sauce on our food, we become upset, because we 
don't like it. We haven’t been eating tomato sauce for 10 years and still react 
in the same way. There is some disliking there because we have conditioned 
the mind. We have done this in many, many ways throughout our lives. We 
have developed little habits, tendencies. So we need to have a look at these. 
We need to see the suffering that these tendencies have caused us and then 
we will be able to let them go, to be able to break the cycle of reaction. We 
don’t have to be reacting machines. We can be alert and aware in the present 
moment, allowing whatever it is to arise noting it, knowing it and letting it 
go.


## First hindrance kāmacchanda


So the first hindrance is known as
*kāmacchanda*
or sensual desire. It 
means desiring things of the sense doors, wanting sensual pleasures, wanting pleasurable objects that arise through the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body 
doors. It is a state of mind of wanting, seeking, wanting to get something, 
wanting to change something. When you’re wanting things. When the mind 
goes off desiring, yearning, a strong desire to get a higher education degree 
or a strong desire to try and buy an expensive house or get a fancy car or 
whatever it may be. Have a look if your mind is inclining towards this. «Oh I 
like that yoga mat, oh that is a nice top I want to get», whatever it is that you 
start looking at and start liking and wanting. It is amazing how the mind will 
 [117]{.pdfpage}  find something even in the barren environment to start liking, to start wanting. We are looking at the tendency. Not so much the objects. We want to 
know if the mind energy of sensual desire is there. We want to see if there is 
any inclination of the mind wanting to go out and enjoy sensuality. Passion. 
Lusting. Maybe you have spotted someone on the retreat and had a look at 
their body having lustful thoughts. Or you're thinking about when lunch is 
going to be. There can be many other different things that we crave for, that 
we wish for. So have a look at this kind of coveting mind.

Especially  for  beautiful  things.  We  hope  and  desire  and  want  things 
which are beautiful. We think they will make us happy in some way. Desirous, we work hard to get the things that we think are beautiful.

Sometimes  we  are  just  after  refinements  in  sensuality.  You  have  a 
cotton  shirt  and  want  to  get  a  silk  shirt.  You  want  other  flip-flops.  Other 
sunglasses, thinking of upgrading, to get things better. Maybe you are thinking  of  upgrading  your  boyfriend  or  maybe  of  upgrading  to  a  new  kind  of 
relationship. You're trying to get things better. This kind of energy that flows 
through the mind of wanting. It’s reaching out to things and desiring them. 
This is a hindrance that comes to play in our meditation practice. When we 
sit  and  meditate  and  it  starts  to  want  something.  Maybe  it’s  something  at 
home, maybe some kind of recognition, maybe it wants some power, or it 
wants to be somebody famous. It wants to be something.

Looking  for  nice  food  when  getting  out  of  here,  wanting  to  go  to  a 
party, dancing, fun activities. That’s fine but just have a look at that craving, 
wanting energy. We normally go for these kind of objects when we are experiencing dukkha, when there is some unpleasantness in our life. When we are 
maybe not too comfortable in a dorm room, when we have been sitting on 
the floor for many hours, when we are extremely tired or frustrated. Perhaps 
the sound of my voice starts to annoy you thinking this is unbearable for you. 
Whatever it is that you’re kind of finding that you want to change. You're 
wanting something to be different. Look at that! There is nothing wrong here 
but there may be some resistance in your mind.

You  may  be  missing  the  normal  objects  that  you  delight  yourself. 
Maybe  you're  used  to  having  an  evening  beer  and  a  joint.  Maybe  you’re 
missing  your  partner,  your  lover.  Maybe  you  want  to  have  certain  food,  a 
 [118]{.pdfpage}  certain  environment.  Maybe  you  are  missing  a  comfortable  bed.  «I  want 
air-con.» These are simple things that we start to think about, but they come 
to disturb our meditation. Particularly if we start looping and thinking about 
them again and again. Be careful because you start to condition the mind.

The  Buddha  gives  us  a  simile  of  dyed  water.  The  water  is  normally 
crystal-clear but the water has become all colored and we cannot see through 
the water too clearly. This is what the mind with sensual desire is like. The 
normal state of the mind without the five hindrances is bright and clear. It 
knows things. It sees things quite clearly. Because of these hindrances it has 
become clouded with color so that we can't see into it. We can't see things as 
they really are. We are seeing our projections and our conceptualizations that 
we paint on top of everything.

So  we’re  bringing  ourselves  into  the  present  moment,  activate  our 
awareness, become aware of this sensual desire in our mind. Try not to get 
caught up in the story of the sensual desire. That means don't think about the 
objects of your sensual desire – pizza, girls, going on a diving trip, whatever it is that you’re wanting. You can be sure that everyone will have some 
sensual desire, something we can enjoy through the eye, ear, nose, tongue 
or  the  body  doors. This  is  very  much  how  we  spend  our  time  here  in  the 
human realm. Most of our time we spend chasing something delightful that 
we  can  enjoy. We  want  things.  Have  a  look  at  that. When  you  notice  that 
there is any desiring of something, make a note ‚desiring, desiring, wanting, 
wanting, lusting, lusting,…’ nothing is too small to note. No thought that is 
arising is too small, too insignificant to note. We need to note continuously 
because  what  is  happening  is  the  mind  is  going  into  the  objects,  and  then 
we note, and we’re coming out of it. We go in and then we come out. We go 
in and then we come out. This is because our awareness and wisdom is not 
continuous enough yet. So we can note something, then we wander a little 
bit, note something and wander again a little bit. We want to get to the stage 
where we can hold back the whole flood of objects coming in through the 
six sense doors with our awareness and our wisdom so that we don’t go out 
of our meditation practice. So that we can create a void area, a demilitarized 
zone, if you like around all these mind objects. So we can stay back and not 
let them touch us or disturb us in any way.


## Second hindrance vyāpāda


[119]{.pdfpage} The second hindrance is known as
*vyāpāda*. It means ill will or aversion. This is the mind state which does not like stuff. The opposite of the first 
one. It is always trying to get rid of something. This is the type of mental 
reaction if we don’t like something. We develop some kind of aversion or 
anger it can escalate to, states of irritation, where the mind becomes annoyed 
with something, maybe it’s some kind of frustration state. Once it arises, if 
we  don't  note  it  and  know  it,  it’s  going  to  start  looping,  it's  going  to  start 
turning around again and again, irritating us, getting us more upset, getting 
us more unmindful and then going into it again, thinking about it again, not 
wanting this, anything but this. To get out of here. These kind of mind states 
start to arise.

We start judging, comparing, complaining, resisting things. We want to 
push them away. We don't like it. Look at this type of energy, this frustration 
or  annoyance  or  aversion  or  judgment.  Maybe  you're  judging  others.  Out 
there on the walking path, you're looking at other people, judging: «Oh, they 
are not walking very fast. Walking too fast. They're being slack. They're not 
sitting. Oh, they're leaning against a wall. Oh, she’s sitting very straight.» 
Maybe  you're  judging  people  like  that. You  start  comparing  yourself  with 
others.

Maybe  you  have  some  unfulfilled  expectations.  Maybe  you  thought 
you’re  going  to  come  here,  sitting  nice  and  peaceful,  with  candles  and 
incense, with Spa music in the background. No, your expectations have not 
been fulfilled!

Maybe you started blaming others: «I can't meditate because that girl 
is always coughing. I can't do the walking meditation, because that guy is 
moving his arms around all time. I can't get any sleep because lizards are in 
my room.» Maybe you start to blame the whole world for all your troubles
here.
*There's  nothing  wrong  with  the  world!  There  may  be  some  issues  in*
*your mind*. So have a look at this stuff as it starts to bubble up.

Sometimes it can be funny to have a look at the mind. Again and again 
to see how ridiculous our reactions are. We find it amusing if we can pull 
ourselves out it. If we can’t pull ourselves out of it, we start looping, we start 
to cause ourselves a lot of dukkha.

[120]{.pdfpage}  Have a look at that pushing away energy. Have a look at the mind, the 
image of your reaction. That's all it’s doing. It's reacting to things. It's like a 
two year old. It's not getting what it wants. «I want it to be otherwise. I don't 
wanted to be like this. I want to be like that.» See how you're reacting. If 
you are reacting like that and identifying with those mind states, is it causing happiness or suffering? Can you feel the suffering flowing through your 
veins of the body? Can you feel being upset with it? If you don't deal with it 
here, where are you going to deal with it? It's just going to keep coming up. 
You're going to keep reacting in the same way until you set yourself up to 
be a constant reactor. Maybe a nuclear reactor if you get upset about people. 
There are some explosions awaiting to happen.

Maybe you are comparing. Some people have been to different meditation retreats, done a few different techniques and they've started to compare. 
«On  this  retreat  we  were  allowed  to  do  that.  Here  we’re  not  allowed  to.» 
You start to get aversion toward something. Comparing, judging. «This one 
is better for me. The food is really good here but the silence is really good 
there.»

So have a look at the complaining or criticizing mind. Your reflections 
or your criticism of things that are going on, are just a reflection of your own 
mind. It's just displaying how you are reacting in the world. When we are 
here in silence, it’s a very good chance to see what we are. It's a very good 
chance to see how our mind reacts and to see how we can handle how our
mind reacts to things.
*You're going to have to come to terms with your mental 
states at some time. You have to watch them.*

*If you are not aware of them or don't know how to deal with them, you*
*will be constantly in trouble.*
Constantly causing yourself stress. You are a 
‘the grass is always greener over there’-person. Constantly shuffling. «It's 
not good enough here, I have to go over there.»

Sometimes people run around looking for enlightenment. They think 
happiness is going to be outside somewhere. Maybe in a particular ashram in 
the Himalaya, maybe on a beach in South America. But that is not how it is.
These things are happening in the mind.
*Our problems are in the mind.*
Happiness is right here and dukkha is right here as well – right here in this very
body!
*«In this fathom length body is dukkha, the arising of dukkha, the ces-*
*sation of dukkha and the path leading to the cessation do dukkha.»*
[121]{.pdfpage}   We don’t 
need to look outside anywhere for our supreme happiness. It is right here!

External  stuff  is  just  a  distraction  for  us.  It’s  just  sensuality.  Just  to 
kind of keep us going so the whole world doesn't implode in some enormous 
dukkha state. If we didn't have any sensuality, imagine what an existence we 
would be living in. If we didn't have awareness and wisdom and couldn’t 
engage in sensuality, then our life would become a never-ending nightmare. 
– So start to have a look at this. Start to have a look at your mind state.

See  if  you  are  pushing  something  away,  if  you’re  not  satisfied  with 
something. Have a look at the dissatisfied mind. Sometimes it can lead to 
hatred, sometimes it can lead to anger, sometimes it can even lead to thoughts 
of violence. «If that guy bangs that dorm room door one more time….». You 
start to have thoughts like that.

So make a note that your mind starts judging, starts comparing, starts 
complaining, having negative experiences towards things. Take note of that. 
Step out of that looping mind state. Free yourself from it. Just make a little 
bit of effort, ‘comparing, judging, judging, dissatisfied, dissatisfied’ and step 
back from that.

Who is it who is dissatisfied? Who is complaining here? What's going 
on? There is a mental state that is bouncing around inside your head. And 
you are identifying with it. Holding it, claiming it to be you. That of course 
causes you dukkha. If you can stop identifying with it, then it stops bouncing 
around. It disappears.

It only stays, if we’re identifying with it. Objects remain in the present, if we identify with them. When we don’t identify, they pass! They pass 
very quickly and they're gone. And they come back again, and they are gone. 
Come back again, gone again. This is the power of awareness and wisdom. 
So try not to get stuck or caught in the story of your own aversions, of your 
own dissatisfactions, of your judgments.

The Buddha said, that this type of mind state, is like boiling water. You 
can’t see into the water. It's boiling, it's bubbling. So we need to turn off the 
gas. Allow the water to calm down and then we will be able to see into this 
particular mind state.


## Third hindrance thīnamiddha


[122]{.pdfpage}  The  third  hindrance,  that  we  all  have  been  experiencing,  is  called
*thīnamiddha*.  It  is  normally  translated  as  sloth  and  torpor,  but  because 
nobody knows what that means, we translate it as laziness and boredom.

This is the kind of mind state which comes to infect us, when we start 
to become «uuhf», lazy. We start to become bored of things. We can't raise 
enough energy even to lift our head up. Our body is slump.

In sitting meditation, you think, «I’ll just sit here and pretend», waiting 
for the bell, waiting for lunchtime. Maybe the head’s on the wall. You started 
nodding away. Sleeping. Have a look if you have been infected by this kind 
of laziness energy.

It can be quite troubling. It starts as tiredness and then you start thinking about being tired. You start to feed it. You need to note it clearly, «oh, 
there is some tiredness occurring». Don’t continue thinking «I'm so tired, I 
want to sleep», «my meditation will go much better if I had a sleep now», «I 
will have a good sitting after lunch». Don't start listening to this nonsense! 
There is some tiredness occurring. «I am so tired, I really need to sleep, my 
meditation will go much better if I sleep. I need 9 hours a day. I can't function.» Have a look if your mind starts going into that.

Have a look if your mind starts having states of boredom. If you are 
not noting and knowing, of course, you will be experiencing some boredom.
Who wants to sit in a hall for nine hours a day and not doing anything?
*Of*
*course it's boring, so you will need to start meditating!*
If you start to attach 
with states of boredom, what does it mean? «I am boring.» So you become a 
boring person if you start to identify with your mind states. There's nothing 
boring here, but there maybe some boredom occurring in your mind. Please 
be aware of that. See it for what it is. See dullness, see the lethargy, see the 
flatness and the apathy.

If you started thinking in that way, if you started looping in that way, 
then you're going to be causing yourself a lot of distress. You're going to be 
getting yourself upset. You're going to start freaking out. So stop it! Just stop 
it and have a look at the mind. Stop it from being slack and inactive. Start 
noting.  Starting  being  aware  of  whatever  physical  posture  you  are  in.  Be 
aware of the rising and falling. Be aware of sounds and smells and sights. Be 
 [123]{.pdfpage}  aware of all the stuff that is going on.

In the beginning stages it might seem a bit boring to watch the breath, 
but once we start to connect with it, wow, you will see that it is anything 
but boring. In fact, it will become the most fascinating thing you have ever 
experienced once you connect with the breath, once your mind goes into the 
breath and becomes one with the breath truly able to follow it in the present 
moment. You will find that it is an extremely fascinating thing.

It's just a matter of checking your attitude and then redirecting yourself  to  the  practice.  Directing  yourself  away  from  your  looping,  habitual 
thoughts of negativity. Just step out of that pattern that’s going on. Step out 
of it and start doing the practice! In that way you will be able to overcome 
that state of sleepiness, of sluggishness or boredom.

Practical  things  we  can  do  to  overcome  sleepiness  and  tiredness 
include: take a shower, splash water on yourself, look up into the bright sky, 
fill your mind with light, pull your ears. In your walking meditation you can 
walk a bit faster for the first five minutes. Build up some momentum, build 
some energy up. If you're creeping around super, super slow for 40 minutes, 
you may not be becoming invigorating enough, you may not have enough 
energy to keep noting.

If you are feeling tired in the sitting meditation, open your eyes. Or if 
you are feeling so tired that you’ve started nodding, just stand up and meditate and then sit down again. We are just transitioning between postures – 
meditation takes place in the mind. It is mind training. It doesn't matter what 
posture your body is in. Traditionally we sit in the cross legged posture but 
it's quite possible to meditate in chairs, to meditate while standing or walking. It’s even possible to meditate while we are lying down. So use all these 
postures and develop continuous awareness. This will help you to overcome 
the third hindrance.

When you’re becoming weary or slack, notice when the mind is tired. 
Vigorously  note  it  when  the  mind  is  feeling  tired  until  the  point  where  it 
steps back and the tiredness is over there and your awareness and wisdom 
are over here. Two different things. Two completely separate things and you 
can choose whether you want to go into the tiredness or whether you want 
to stay in alertness. Tiredness just becomes another object. When we are not 
 [124]{.pdfpage}  in it, when we are not identifying with it, it's not you that’s tired, there is 
tiredness! Start to view these hindrances through the prism of the four noble 
truths.

The  four  noble  truths  always  start  with
*«there  is..  »*.  That's  the  way 
the  Buddha  instructed  us  to  see  the  four  noble  truths.  There  is  suffering. 
There is tiredness. There is wanting. There is aversion. There is disliking.
*It is not you!*
But that is what is arising in the present moment right now. 
You can step away from that. Stop conditioning your mind with those states. 
Normally, we go into them and start conditioning the mind and then we’ll 
become  those  states. A  craving  person,  an  angry  person  or  a  lazy  person. 
We keep fueling ourselves with this. We keep programming ourselves with 
these hindrances and then that's what we become. So be very aware and very 
careful not to start indulging in these mental states when they are coming up 
and disturb our meditation.

The  Buddha  gives  a  simile  of  a  pond,  that's  covered  by  some  green 
vegetation. Pond scum. When that stuff is growing on the water, you can't 
see into the water. You can’t see the clear water of the pond. It's temporarily 
covered. So just push away that pond scum.

Make a note: ‘tiredness, laziness, boredom’ is there. Make a note and 
let it go. It may take five or six notings, it may take 10 times to note for a 
particular mental state. In the initial stage we do it once or twice and it might 
disappear a little bit then it comes back. We note it again. And we know it 
again. We keep noting it. We keep hammering it away until it gets the idea: 
this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. We start to separate from 
the mental state.

If we stop identifying with these mental states, they loose all power. 
They loose their conditioning power. They loose their ability to act as a base 
or a foundation for the sense of self. Me, mine and I simply can’t arise when 
we are noting and knowing persistently in the present moment.


## Fourth hindrance uddhachakukkucca


The  fourth  hindrance  is  known  as
*uddhachakukkucca*,  which  means 
restlessness and worry. This is the type of mind state that comes upon us, 
when we start to worry about things. We become restless about things. You 
 [125]{.pdfpage}  have all experienced this wandering mind. It's wandering here, it's wandering there. It's unrest. It's wanting something else. It's desiring to anything. It 
wants to read something. It's getting anxious about something. Maybe you're 
starting to having withdrawals from information. We are all used to being 
bombarded with so much information. We haven't got our devices or books 
with us. So the mind starts getting a little bit restless. It hasn't got its normal 
toys to play with. So it's becoming more and more restless.

Planning  the  future  –  it's  wandering.  Thinking  about  what  it's  going 
to be doing next week. Planning to make your life a success in someway. 
Maybe you are thinking about the past, long forgotten memories are coming 
up. You're starting to play to go through old conversations. Recognize when 
the mind is wandering. Make a note ‘wandering, wandering, remembering, 
remembering, planning, planning’. Quite often we spend most of our time 
just wandering in thoughts in the future, planning things that will never come 
true. Just nonsense! Of course, you all need to make decisions at some point 
in your life and we can do that with wise attention. We can decide how we 
make our decisions wisely depending on what the causes or purposes of our 
motivation is. We can see which is the best decision to be made in that way.
Become  aware  if  you  are  having  concern  for  outside  things.  If  your 
mind is wandering to the outside. Maybe you're becoming restless. Maybe 
you're  becoming  upset.  Maybe  you  are  feeling  guilty  about  something. 
Maybe you are experiencing some fear or maybe you are scared of something.

Be sure not to condition yourself with these kind of thoughts, sometimes irrational thoughts. We’ll get in all kind of phobias, all kinds of belief 
systems when we start to believe our own thoughts. We start to listen to these 
very impermanent, dependently arisen, conditioned thoughts that come up 
and pass away. They arise and pass away. Arise and pass away. We take them 
very seriously. We start to identify with them. Of course, they cause us much 
trouble.

Maybe you are worrying about the retreat. «I am trying hard, but it's 
not  working.  I'm  not  going  to  get  any  results.  I  am  hopeless.  It  is  day  3 
already  and  I  am  still  not  enlightened.  What's  wrong?»  You  are  used  to 
achieving, setting your goals but it's not working. Your expectations are not 
 [126]{.pdfpage}  fulfilled.  You  are  becoming  restless  and  upset  or  you  are  worrying  about 
your meditation results. Maybe you're worrying about what other people are 
going to think about you, when you tell them about your meditation results. 
All kinds of things that people worry about and get stressed about. No-one 
is interested in what your meditation is doing, except me. I'm of course very 
interested and hope that you’re along the path. But don't think that you have 
to try and achieve something or get something by you or for you.

This  can  be  big  source  of  problems  for  people.  They  want  so  very 
much to get it. And then of course after two days of tiredness, it's not working, you become upset. «It's not working. This system doesn't work. I have 
tried now.»

No! It is just like going to the supermarket and buying the ingredients 
and then say the cake does not work. But you have to make the cake first, 
you have to do the cooking. Buying the ingredients is not enough. You actually  have  to  do  some  work. Vipassana  is  exactly  the  same.  Just  sitting  on 
the mat with your eyes closed and waiting for some insight to fall from the 
heaven – it just does not happen like that! No! Insights are conditioned, it’s 
conditioned phenomena. You all need to put the conditions in place and we 
are all working towards that. The more efficiently and effectively you can 
line up all the conditions, that is when the magic starts to happen. If you are 
neglecting  some  particular  condition,  then  start  to  work  on  that  one.  The 
things I have been saying, all need to be put into the actions. They are all 
conditions for the arising of insights.

The wandering mind can be very useful. It teaches us that things are out 
of control. It teaches us that thoughts just keep coming, they just keep arising. Meditation practice is not to stop the thinking. We are trying to observe 
it, to watch it and detach from it. You're not interested in perpetuating the 
thinking. Don’t fuel it by thinking about it again and again. What happens 
when you do that? We all know! You become upset. When there is an object 
of resentment and then you keep thinking about it again and again, then you 
get yourself upset. This is how we become upset, through constantly thinking about something that we think is negative. If we get in a serious habit 
of that, then we get depression. Or, we end up with anxiety. We end up with 
some  serious  mental  disorder,  because  of  the  thinking.  It’s  just  thoughts! 
 [127]{.pdfpage}  There is nothing wrong with you, but no-one taught us to have a look at these 
thoughts before. Step back from them, they are not you. They don’t belong 
to you, nothing to do with you! It’s conditioned phenomena. If you identify 
with them, dukkha! If you don't identify, freedom! So start to step back from 
your  own  mind,  from  the  thoughts,  the  restlessness  and  worrying.  Don’t 
follow the story. That is what this restlessness is all about. We haven’t been 
fast enough in noting the thoughts. A thought has come up and then it started 
blossoming into a story. And we started following along with that story. So 
try to note the thoughts before they start to turn into stories. Before they take 
you away for 10 minutes to another country, to another conversation with 
another person, and then you wake up when you hear the bell.

Knowing that we are thinking, that those five hindrances are within us 
is already a good start. We need to be able to recognize them, see when we 
are being attacked by them, and then step away from them. It is not good 
enough to recognize that they are there and then continue to allow them to 
keep going. We want to cut that behavior. It is not easy! Because our reaction 
patterns have become habitual, we have probably reacted in the same way 
for 20, 30 years. It has become a habit. So we are addicted to our reaction 
patterns. We think that is who we are. «I don't like this, this, this and this.» 
It's  already  been  decided  that  these  things  are  bad  and  need  to  be  pushed 
away. So every time, when we encounter them, reaction. Dukkha. Reaction. 
Dukkha. Every time we come in contact with those things, dukkha. Try to 
step  away  from  that  position,  even  if  you  have  been  holding  that  position 
for a long time. Try to step away from your views, opinions. These views 
and opinions are just rooted in wrong view. They don't belong to anybody. 
Don't become a person that has become fixed in their wrong view. The older 
people get, the more and more they are fixed in the ways of doing things. 
«This  is  the  exact  way  you  need  to  make  a  cup  of  tea.  First  tea  bag,  then 
water, then milk.» If you put first the milk in, then they start reacting in this 
way. It’s just a simple habit that we got used to. And then we think the tea 
tastes somehow differently. They can get quite upset, and even not drink the 
cup of tea.

So have a look at those kinds of little patterns that we get ourselves 
into the trouble that these patterns make. Everything is up for auction in the 
 [128]{.pdfpage}  mind. All the mind states can be let go of! None of them belong to you. Get 
rid of it. Let it go. Let go of the thoughts and patterns. Free the mind from its 
tendency to be in a certain way.

The Buddha gives us a simile of wind whipped water. It's like water out 
there on the ocean on a windy day. Lots of little white caps. You can’t see 
down to the sand. The surface of the water is uncalm. It's disturbed.


## Fifth hindrance vicikicchā


The fifth hindrance is known as skeptical doubt or
*vicikicchā*
or skepticism. It’s uncertainty, doubt in the mind. Sometimes we start experiencing 
doubt. We are unsure about the practice. We are hesitating. We are uncertain 
about  what  we  are  doing.  Perhaps  you  are  uncertain  about  the  Buddha’s 
teaching.  Maybe  you're  not  quite  sure  if  the  Buddha  was  correct  or  not. 
Maybe you are doubting about the meditation technique that we are teaching here. Maybe you're having doubt about me as being a teacher. Maybe 
you're having doubts about your own ability to do the practice. Maybe you're 
having thoughts of low self-confidence. You're doubting the practice and you 
are  doubting  yourself.  You  are  switching  between  meditation  techniques, 
sometimes at the nose, sometimes at the abdomen. «I do it this way then I 
do it that way.» The mind is not confident enough to fulfill the training. The
faculty of confidence or faith, the faculty of
*saddha*
is weak.

You  need  to  boost  up  that  a  little  bit. You  need  to  become  confident 
with what we're doing here. People have been doing this for a long time and 
experiencing  the  results.  Your  ability  to  put  the  instructions  into  practice 
will  determine  the  results  of  your  practice. You  shouldn't  have  any  doubt 
about that. This is a conditioned, impersonal process. It has got nothing to 
do with you! We are putting in place various conditions and then it happens 
by itself. It's beyond our control. So have no doubt about that! Just put the 
instructions in place!

Have a look at this mind state of doubt. It can really destroy your practice. If you start to think «this technique is hopeless», or «I can not do it, this 
is not what I want», you’ve tipped yourself out. You’ve fallen over. See if 
you are entertaining thoughts of doubt.

[129]{.pdfpage}  So these are the five hindrances. Sensual desire and ill will, laziness 
and  boredom,  restlessness  and  worry  and  skeptical  doubt. These  five  hindrances will come and attack us in our meditation practice. Many things we 
do on this retreat are specifically designed to overcome these five hindrances. 
We are working on restraining our sense doors. We are restraining our 
food intake. We are keeping the eight precepts. If we have a look at the eight 
precepts, we will see that actually the sixth, seventh and eighth precepts are 
all about restraining the sense doors. We are restraining by eating food only 
in the morning. We are restraining the delight that can arise at the tongue 
door. We are not dancing, singing, listening to music. We are restraining the 
ear door and the body door in those activities. We are not watching shows, 
DVDs  or  films.  So  we  are  restraining  the  eye  door. We  are  not  using  perfumes and flowers so that we can restrain the nose door. We are not sleeping 
on high and luxurious beds. So we’re restraining the body door.

This  is  a  restraint  mechanism  so  that  we  can  practice.  We  need  to 
restrain these five hindrances from arising and we need to restrain the sense 
doors so sensuality or sensual desire doesn't start to arise. This is all to overcome the first hindrance of sensual desire.

We  are  practicing  the  loving  kindness  meditation  as  an  antidote  to 
anger or frustration or irritations so that we don’t have ill will and aversion 
in our mind.

We are being moderate in our eating taking just two meals a day. We 
are devoted to wakefulness, getting up very early and going to bed quite late. 
We're devoted to being awake and alert while on the retreat here. This is so 
that we can overcome the third hindrance of laziness and boredom.

All the activities on the retreat here are to overcome something. They 
are an aid to us. So try to join in the restraints for your benefit!

We have a fixed schedule so we don’t need to worry about what to do. 
We are removing those kind of distractions of choosing where we can go or 
what we can do. There is no choice. We are just following along here. We are 
following the precepts that we don’t have to worry that our sila or morality 
or virtue isn't at the right level for our meditation practice.

And of course, we are doing the chanting and bowing to develop faith 
and confidence in the Buddha’s teachings and the sangha. And we developed 
 [130]{.pdfpage}  a measure of confidence within ourselves as well. We gain a reflective acceptance of the teaching. We are listening to the talks, understanding, putting 
the practice into action. We are developing a measure of confidence and faith 
in the Buddha’s teaching.

Have a look at the translation on your chanting sheets. There are nine 
qualities of the Buddha, six qualities of the dhamma and nine qualities of the
sangha that we can recollect.
*Buddhanusati, dhammanusati, sanghanusati*. 
That word sati at the end means mindfulness. Mindfulness of the qualities of 
the Buddha, of the dhamma and the sangha. Start to appreciate the gloriousness of the Buddha’s teaching! Start to appreciate how deep and profound 
the  dhamma  is.  And  appreciate  those  people  who  have  come  across  the 
teaching before us and have done the practice and have realized the results 
for themselves. They are the ones who have passed the knowledge down to 
us! So we can also come in touch with that teaching. Faith and confidence is 
as such developed to remove doubt.

It is important to know that these mind states are objects of our mediation. They are not just disturbances. Don’t think you can’t meditate because 
of the hindrances. They are the objects, the things we need to be watching. 
They are the things which cause troubles. That's where the dukkha is coming 
from. These five hindrances. Sensual desire – not getting it, unhappy. Anger 
– getting it, not happy. When we are lazy and bored – not happy. When we 
are restless and agitated – we're not happy. When we are doubting and lacking  confidence  –  not  happy.  Dukkha  is  arising  when  we  are  entertaining 
these five hindrances. So you will need to note and know them and let them 
go. None of them are you! They don't belong to you. If you identify with 
them,  dukkha!  If  you  can  note,  know  and  let  them  go,  than  you  are  free! 
You have freed the mind from them. And do it again! Train the mind to be 
free – that is all what our mediation practice is about. We are training the 
mind to be free in any situation! Whatever is arising in the present moment 
can be noted, known and let go of! All conditioned objects have the same 
structure. They all arise, get clung to, stop getting clung to, and pass away. 
Now, how long they stay, depends on how long you identify with that state. 
If you're identifying with it strongly, then you will have all day this state of 
agitation. You pick it up in the morning and it will be disturbing you all the 
 [131]{.pdfpage}  way through to lunchtime until you find something else to be distracted by. 
But  if  you  can  note  it  quickly  –  dissolved! Very  rapidly! And  then  a  new 
object – and dissolved. Dissolved. Dissolved. If we can get our mind into a 
stable mode of perception, with awareness and wisdom continuously arising, noting, knowing every object – then we get ourselves into a state which
is called
*udayabbaya ñāṇa*, the knowledge of arising and passing away. We 
start  to  see  all  mental  and  physical  phenomena  arising  and  passing  away 
very, very rapidly because nothing is being identified with. It is all being let 
go of! Very, very quickly. Until the mind drops. Until the objects stop passing away and the mind goes into cessation. It stops identifying with all the 
rapidly arising and passing away phenomena, that we have been able to note 
continuously – nothing getting identified with that state of mind, there is no 
sense of self arising, just conditioned phenomena until – whoop, this thing 
goes out, «wfuuh», like a candle that you put out with the wind of your hand, 
«wfuuh». It's gone. The mind and body process ceases. It turns into cessation 
mode and things temporarily cease. Dukkha ceases. This is a little taste of 
the deathless. Not a full taste of nirvana but it is something quite close. And 
that is all within reach of our meditation retreat this week.

Don’t  beat  yourself  up,  if  you  find  yourself  under  attack  by  the  five 
hindrances. We are all. We all have to work through them. We just need to 
deal with them patiently, have tolerance. Don’t become tricked by the mind 
into becoming upset by your mind state. Have a look around you. It's a so 
delightful environment here and the food is very good. All you need to do 
is to have a look at your mind and see what is really going on there. Don't 
attach to these hindrances. Don't pick them up when you notice that they are 
floating around. Our job is to note them, to know them and to let them go.
