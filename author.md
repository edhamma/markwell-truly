[301]{.pdfpage}  Anthony  ordained  as  a  Buddhist  monk  aged  24  at  Wat  Khao  Chong 
Lom in 1995 with his first teacher the late Ven. Phra Acharn Leua Pannavaro. He was instructed in satipatthana vipassana at Vivek Asom Meditation 
Centre by Ven. Ajhan Charee Jaruvanno and Ven. Ajahn Somsak Sorado, and 
practiced intensely at Wat Don Put under the late Ven. Luang Por Bhavanakitti, a rare monk of noble wisdom. He moved to Myanmar to continue his 
training in the Mahasi method in 1996, receiving strict personal supervision 
during a seven-month retreat with the late  Ven. Sayadaw U Pandita at Panditarama, Yangon. Those two years revelled the method and mode of insight 
practice.

The lure of the forest monk lifestyle and deep concentration led Anthony 
to seek out the Ven. Sayadaw U Acinna in 1997 at the Pa Auk Forest Monastery, where he received instruction for a year in anapanasati (mindfulness 
with breathing) and four elements meditation. Anthony retreated to the hills 
 [302]{.pdfpage}  of the Shan State for a further year of meditation in an isolated monastery. 
After four years in robes and constant practice, Anthony studied Buddhist 
texts and Pali language at the International Buddhist University in Yangon 
consolidating his meditation experiences with scriptural studies. His interest in Pali was furthered through self-study whilst living at the Shwedagon 
Pagoda in 2000.

A two-year pilgrimage gave the opportunity to wander and dwell in the 
forest meditation monasteries of Sri Lanka. He attended the Kalachakra Initiation with His Holiness the Dalai Lama in Bodhgaya 2002, and developed 
an  interest  in  choiceless  awareness  meditation  techniques  during  visits  to 
monasteries in India, Nepal, China and Tibet.  Anthony spent three extended 
rains retreats between 2002 – 2005 practicing satipatthana vipassana at Wat 
Pitsoparam, Ubon Ratchathani, with the late Ven. Luang Por Visarnkemakoon. In  2006, returned home, disrobing from the monkhood after 11 vassa. 
He experienced life in Melbourne studying and working in the wholesale diamond and gemstone industry for seven years until 2012. He returned 
to Thailand in 2013, and at the request of Ven. Ajahn Poh (Suan Mokkh) led 
popular meditation retreats at Wat Kow Tahm between 2013-2016, where he 
guided  thousands  of  meditators  through  silent  monthly  7-day    and  annual 
21-day vipassana retreats.

**Present:** He  is  currently  working  to  establish  the  infrastructure  for  Indriya 
Retreat – Dhamma and Meditation Hall in a secluded fruit garden in Koh 
Phangan. He plans to start leading non-residential vipassana retreats in 2019.
