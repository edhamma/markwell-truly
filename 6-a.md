# Morning Talk



This morning we are going to continue to look at the bojjhangas, the 
enlightenment factors.


## Enlightenment factors, bojjhangas


We’ve had a look at three of the enlightenment factors already. Energy, 
mindfulness  and  investigation.  Those  three  states  spinning  on  each  other, 
doing the work. Activating awareness in the present, seeing things clearly, 
letting them go – this is the work of the first three enlightenment factors. As 
we develop these enlightenment factors, the other four come to be fulfilled 
or get developed. We don’t become enlightened by reading or studying the 
scriptures or by thinking or by wishing that enlightenment just burst one’s 
mind. There need to be certain conditions in place for this to happen. And 
those conditions are the seven enlightenment factors.

These seven bojjhangas can be seen in all stages of our Vipassana practice. They don’t fully develop and become quite clear to the mind until the 
stage of the knowledge of the arising of passing away, until we can tune in 
our mind into that frequency of arising and passing, seeing things just arising and passing away, the mind not clinging or holding to anything. At the 
point of contact where consciousness is arising at the six bases, we are able 
to activate awareness so it joins with consciousness. It’s able to know that 
 [210]{.pdfpage}  present moment experience.

The  development  of  the  seven  enlightenment  factors  can  be  looked 
upon as a president with the ministers, like a king or queen surrounded by 
the seven ministers. All those ministers having their functions and their role 
to play within the cabinet, within the structure of the organization.

Consciousness is just the knowing. That’s all it does. It knows stuff. If 
the mental factors that are surrounding consciousness are the hindrances, for 
example, that’s what we know. That’s what our experience is. If the seven 
enlightenment  factors  surround  the  consciousness  than  our  experience  is 
something  quite  different.  So  here  we  are  developing  these  seven  enlightenment factors. We are practicing, activating our awareness, noting what’s 
there,  stepping  back  from  the  phenomena  –  mental  or  physical,  pleasant 
or  unpleasant  –  and  allowing  it  to  pass  away.  Of  course,  it’s  very  quickly 
replaced  by  a  new  object.  Something  new  comes  to  the  attention  of  consciousness. We are not going into that story. We are not sinking into it, we 
are not appropriating it, we are not holding it. We are letting it go. We are 
knowing them, knowing them clearly.

These  enlightenment  factors  allow  consciousness  to  know  in  a  very 
particular way. In fact, they surround consciousness to elevate it onto a very 
particular type of knowing, a path knowing, knowing in the manner of the 
noble eightfold path.

We are practicing the four foundations of mindfulness. It doesn’t mean 
studying or thinking or listening to talks about the practice. It doesn’t mean 
discussing them or arguing about the final points. It means sitting down and 
doing the practice!

We have to directly and experientially become aware of the four bases 
on which mindfulness is established and we should practice with this awareness not intermittedly, not sporadically, not with gaps but continuously, persistently and unremittingly. And this is exactly what we do in our Vipassana 
meditation.  As  we  are  noting  and  knowing  and  letting  go,  the  first  three 
enlightenment factors are doing their job.


## [211]{.pdfpage}  Fourth enlightenment factor piti


The fourth enlightenment factor starts to come into our experience. It 
is known as piti. It means rapture. It’s a mental state. It’s a state of mind that 
arises in the meditator when the first three enlightenment factors are up and 
running, when they are working, when we’ve started to note and know and 
let go. This fourth enlightenment factor comes on the scene.

It has the characteristics of zest, or enthusiasm or intense interest. There 
is also some delight. Some satisfaction and some happiness that comes to the 
practice.  Piti’s  role  in  the  practice  is  to  make  the  practice  interesting  and 
exciting and it certainly does that. Some of you will have started to experience the side effects of piti. When piti is in the mind it also causes the body 
to react in certain ways. Physical sensations arise in the body because of the 
mental state of piti. It’s cause and effect there.

The  function  of  this  rapture  is  to  fill  the  mind  with  lightness,  to  fill 
it  with  energy  and  agility,  to  make  it  sharp  and  functioning,  to  make  the 
meditation fun and exciting. It’s bringing a deep sense of satisfaction into 
the practice as well. When this rapture occurs, the cause and uncomfortable 
sensations, that were arising in the body – the painful knee, the soar hips, the 
stabbing in the back – those sensations disappear and they are replaced by 
something that is much softer, much gentler, smooth and light.

Piti manifests in many different ways. For some people it starts to manifest as a lightness throughout the body. You will feel very light, very buoyant in the sitting meditation and also in the walking meditation it happens. 
The body will start to feel like it’s very light, to lift and elevate. Sometimes 
you  might  think  you  are  floating  in  the  air.  It  might  feel  so  light,  that  the 
whole  body  disappears. You  can’t  really  feel  anything.  It  becomes  supercomfortable.  Those  uncomfortable  states  of  just  a  few  days  ago,  kind  of 
disappear when piti is in the mind and is having its effect on the body. Sometimes we feel, when piti is arising, that the body is pushed and pulled. It’s 
being swayed. It starts to rock from front to back, or side to side, sometimes 
it starts to get quite rapid. Sometimes it whirls, it starts to turn, the body is 
turning. The mind is meditating but the body is starting to move around.

If this starts to happen, make a note of that. If you feel some lightness 
in the body, make a note lightness. If you feel it’s being swayed or rocked, 
 [212]{.pdfpage}  make a note of those sensations of rocking. Stay with it, don’t get absorbed 
into the story of piti. Piti can be very enticing. It can be very exciting. When 
it starts to happen we kind of like it. We want it to happen again! Just note 
it when it’s arising. It’s not something that we want to get attached to. It is 
something that we want to develop but we don’t want to be attached. Sometimes it will make us feel as if we are off balance. You are going to tip backwards, you’re going to feel like you’re going to about fall over. You probably 
won’t! Don't worry. All kind of weird sensation that arise in the body. Sometimes there’s thrills and chills. An excitement. Sometimes the body has little 
twitches, little shakes or you have a little vibration session. It starts tingling 
and shaking and twisting. Sometimes it gets quite violent. It feels like some 
lightening balls are coming through the body. Other times it just feels like 
the body’s just plugged in, a kind of buzz going on. We can think it’s quite 
nice when it starts to happen. There’s flashes like lightening or sparks like 
electricity.  Sometimes  you  feel  so  light,  that  you  feel  like  you’re  floating 
away. Am I still on the ground? It might feel like you are flying. But you do 
feel fantastically comfortable and there is no real wish to change position or 
move. When I ring the bell, «I’m not moving from this (audience laughing). 
This is nice!» «But that nice curry is there for lunch.» – «I don’t care. I’m 
going to meditate through this.» Very comfortable this state of piti.

The important thing about piti, it gives us great interest in the practice. 
We start to see some results about our hard work. When it starts to happen, 
we feel validated. «Ok, it starts to happen.» Confidence arises, we put in an 
extra five or ten percent effort. And we draw down a lot of extra on that little 
bit of effort.

The Buddha told us, there is only one cause for rapture: wise attention. 
The arising of rapture is due to bringing in wholesome, rapturous feelings. 
When we are developing rapture, we can do so in a number of ways. Rapture arises when we do our Vipassana practice. Rapture arises when we’re 
contemplating the Buddha, the dhamma and sangha. When we start to think 
about  the  glory  of  the  Buddha,  how  deep  and  wonderful  his  teaching  is, 
when we start to think about all those monks and nuns of hundreds generations that did the practice and passed the teaching down to our current generation, we start to have great respect for what was going on. The teaching 
 [213]{.pdfpage}  that we have been exposed to. This can also bring feelings of rapture. I have 
experienced that myself, when going to see an old teacher. Sometimes the 
rapture can be so strong that we start crying. Some of you may have felt it 
in  the  loving  kindness  meditation. The  body  starts  to  feel  so  comfortable, 
it’s just tears of joy, or tears of relief, or tears of release. Sometimes piti can 
become so strong that the whole body starts to lean forward, it starts to go 
down like that, you can see people’s body rocking, backwards and forwards. 
They are not asleep! This is just the effect of piti on the body.

There  are  many  examples  of  people  who  have  gained  enlightenment 
in the old texts after contemplating the Buddha, dhamma and sangha. This 
is a wonderful way of activating piti in our lives! When we think and reflect 
upon,  when  we  consider  about  the  Buddha,  dhamma  and  sangha  –  that’s 
what we’ve been doing in our evening chanting.

So this piti, when it starts to arise, make sure you note it. Make sure 
you  note  the  manifestations  of  it,  the  physical  sensations.  Make  sure  you 
note the pleasantness of the experience. Make sure you note the actual mind 
state  itself. Try  to  feel  the  enthusiasm  and  the  buzz,  the  electricity  of  piti 
that’s going through the mind. It will be very clear, the actual sensations and 
a lot of joy happening. Be careful not to attach to this state. Be careful not to 
get addicted to this mind state. Sometimes, it can happen on the first couple 
of days of a retreat, people get very excited and then they spend the next five 
days trying to get it back. Trying hard! Meditating with craving! Meditating 
with wanting! So at this stage of the retreat you should all be letting go your 
resistances, and you should be letting go of the past and the future coming 
into  the  present. When  these  types  of  mind  state  arise,  just  note  them.  Be 
aware that they are there. We are not clinging or holding to them. We don’t 
have to get super excited. Although you can be pleased, knowing that your 
practice is developing along the path, that has been very well mapped out. 
Piti is the fourth enlightenment factor that starts to arise.


## Fifth enlightenment factor passaddhi


Leading  on  from  this  stage  of  piti,  is  the  fifth  enlightenment  factor,
that is known as
*passaddhi*
which means tranquility. It means coolness of 
the mind, or calmness or stillness. When things become very tranquil, they 
 [214]{.pdfpage}  become  extremely  quiet,  extremely  still  like  the  water  on  the  surface  of  a 
lake with no wind thereout. Completely still and silent. The buzz, the electricity of piti starts to give way to this calmness and coolness in the mind. We 
become very, very still. Passaddhi arises when mental agitation or restlessness and worry have been put aside, that fourth hindrance. When we stop 
worrying about things, when we’ve stopped wanting and desiring something 
to happen, then tranquility starts to be activated. The body must be silent and 
still and the mind becomes silent and still as well.

The  characteristic  of  tranquility  is  to  calm  the  body  and  to  silence 
and tranquilize agitation. As our meditation develops, energy activates our 
awareness,  turns  it  on,  mindfulness  pays  attention  to  the  present  moment, 
penetrating  that  object  that  is  there,  investigation  thoroughly  understands 
what this object is, that causes the letting go to take place, there is a great 
deal of excitement and buzz when this starts to occur, when we start to free 
the mind from sensuality and start to free the mind from the five hindrances, 
freeing the mind from past and future, so we are internalized with the mind 
and  body  states  and  we’re  not  fussed  about  them,  we’re  not  disturbed  by 
them,  we  are  quite  intent  on  just  watching,  the  body  feels  quite  comfortable – then as this starts to happen, the electric buzz of piti starts to decline 
a little bit and tranquility takes its place. They are both still there! They are 
both still functioning but tranquility becomes stronger and so things start to 
become very quiet, very still. Your body won’t need to move at all. You’ll be 
completely silent and completely comfortable. That four elements, that are 
normally changing in their ratios, normally giving some physical sensations 
in  the  body,  will  just  be  completely  equalized.  There  won’t  be  any  tough 
spots in the body, nothing uncomfortable. It will be perfectly calm. And a 
wonderful state of mind, which will allow us to sit for long periods of time. 
Two hours, three hours, comfortably, silent and still, observing, watching, 
noting, knowing and letting go.

The function of tranquility is to take the heat out of the mind, to suppress  the  heat  of  the  defilements  and  the  heat  of  sensual  objects  that  normally attract us, so the mind can be released from remorse and worry and 
restlessness. When the mind is assaulted by these kinds of harmful states, it 
becomes hot and we become restless. When we become worried – «only two 
 [215]{.pdfpage}  days left of the retreat and still I’m not enlightened» – you start to worry, 
to think about that. When we give that up, when we resign ourselves to the 
fact that we are here and we are doing the practice, then tranquility can start 
and  come  to  play.  Tranquility  of  mind  extinguishes  the  heat  and  replaces 
it with a calm coolness. Tranquility is probably the state you recognize as 
being meditation. When you think of meditation, sitting on top of a hill on 
a tropical island, it’s going to be still and quiet and beautiful. It’s probably 
what you are thinking about this state of tranquility. Do a little bit more work 
and it’s yours to experience. That is what meditation is like. It’s a little bit 
more effort and these states start to expose themselves. Often it’s not just the 
effort, but it’s just time – time for aligning all the conditions. We need put 
all the conditions in place and then these mental states start to arise. Without 
them being in place, it will never arise. We’ll just have thinking or exploring 
mentally ourselves, what we imagine those states of mind to be.

The manifestation of passaddhi is non-agitation of the mind and body. 
Complete stillness, great calm, great clarity, great tranquility. Our mind is 
normally  in  a  state  of  agitation,  jumping  between  the  past  and  the  future, 
going here and there. There isn’t any time for calmness or coolness. There’s 
no silence or peace. There are always thoughts coming into the mind, we’re 
always distracted by external objects, it gets very busy in the head! We normally  don’t  notice  it,  how  busy  things  are  until  we  come  to  a  place  like 
this  and  try  to  watch  it.  Often  it  can  be  quite  horrifying  to  see  the  nature 
of our own mind, to see how it continuously thinks about itself. To watch 
that.  – When  our  mind  becomes  scattered,  it  starts  going  into  the  objects, 
into  the  mental  and  physical  phenomena.  When  it  starts  to  identify  with 
them in some way or enjoy them or delighting them, gain a sense of being 
from them, then we can perform unskillful actions or say unskillful things. 
Speech and actions can lead to remorseful states of mind. We feel, «I probably shouldn’t have said that», we feel we should apologize. We should, if 
we’ve been rude! When the mind gets assaulted by remorse and regret, there 
is no happiness. Tranquility has the ability of removing this remorse and this 
regret, this worry. When we still and calm things down, these states of mind 
evaporate. And then all the ripples in the mind cease. The eye pad becomes 
completely still. You can see very clearly the details of a good photograph.

[216]{.pdfpage}  So this factor of enlightenment follows on rapture, from piti. It arises 
when the previous one is already in place. Thus we need to get excited and 
enthusiastic  about  the  practice.  That  will  lead  us  to  keep  coming  back  to 
the mat. It leads us to keep coming back to the meditation hall or even keep 
coming back to the retreat, month after month. When these different kinds of 
pleasantness start to arise, it can be quite addictive. We want to experience 
that more often. The strongest rapture, the most pervasive rapture is associated with strong tranquility later on. As our rapture becomes stronger, our 
tranquility becomes calmer and stiller. In fact, tranquility starts to overcome 
the rapture. The coolness and calmness of tranquility kind of suppresses the 
electricity  buzz  of  piti.  Both  of  them  are  working  together. They  are  both 
doing their jobs. One is making the mind enthusiastic, one is calming things 
down. They both have a function to play. They both have a role to play in 
balancing and managing the work of consciousness, the work of knowing.

All  these  mental  factors  have  their  job  to  do. We  have  to  make  sure 
they’re fully developed so they can perform their jobs correctly and properly 
when we need them to. So that they can assist consciousness from letting go 
of the mental and physical phenomena. These are the factors of enlightenment, the bojjhanga, these causative factors that lead to enlightenment.

Arousing tranquility, we need to reflect on the causes of tranquility. We 
need to have wise attention. We need to take note after a good sitting. After 
a good sitting, we should explore what just happened. What were the conditions that you just put in place? What was the time of the day? Had you eaten 
nothing? Had you eaten little? What posture were you sitting in? How did 
you begin the practice? Did you do some walking meditation or yoga before 
you sat down? Had you been listening to a talk before going into meditation? Explore those events before the state of tranquility arises. And try to 
replicate them, try to copy them so you get the same results. We are putting 
the conditions in place for things to unfold. So there’s a few tips for you, for 
arousing tranquility.

The first one is, take nutritious and sensible food. Make sure it’s the 
type of food not only satisfying the necessity of eating but it’s suitable for 
you. Make sure it’s actual food that’s been grown and produced and cooked 
properly,  not  only  processed  food  or  food  from  factories.  Try  to  get  food 
 [217]{.pdfpage}  from farms and gardens. Here on Koh Phangan, we have a great supply of 
good food. It should be the kind of food, we feel comfortable with. If you 
like to eat garlic and onion and chilli, if that has been your normal eating 
pattern for the last five or ten years, then you feel comfortable with that. It 
won’t be annoying or agitating. If you are used to eating fruit, if you are used 
to eating bland food or flavorless food, you have to organize that when you 
are doing your meditation practice. Make sure the body is comfortable with 
what kind of food it’s receiving. This will make the body calm and comfortable.

Secondly,  we  should  meditate  in  an  environment  where  the  weather 
is good. We don’t want it too hot, we don’t want it too cold. We don’t want 
to have to wear ski-jackets meditating and big boots when we are walking 
around, but we also don’t want to be sweating continuously. So here on the 
island we get this good weather. It should be comfortable and convenient for 
you to meditate.

Thirdly, adopt a comfortable posture. To get the mind tranquil, you are 
going to have to make the body tranquil. And this can take time. Don’t pressure yourself to start siting in the full lotus, thinking, I will never meditate 
until I can do this posture. You’re maybe twisting yourself for quite some 
time  before  you  start  meditating.  Make  sure  you  find  yourself  a  comfortable posture. We are used to sitting on a chair. That’s fine. I do recommend 
stretching your hips, your legs so that you can establish a comfortable meditation posture. Get it worked out in your first year of your meditation life so 
that you can become comfortable whenever you want to do a sitting.

You  need  to  maintain  a  balanced  effort.  We  shouldn’t  become  over 
enthusiastic. Work super-hard, continuously and then stop and just become 
bored and fed up with it and start again with super-enthusiasm. That’s stopping and starting. This is not great. We want to be continuous in our efforts. 
Have a balanced effort.

We should also avoid bad tempered or rough people if we are tying to 
develop tranquility. You know somebody who’s often excited or animated 
or often gets angry or voices their opinion strongly, people start to mouth 
at  you,  or  talk  rapidly  or  loudly  at  you.  These  are  not  the  kind  of  people 
we  want  to  associate  to  when  we  want  to  develop  tranquility. We  want to 
 [218]{.pdfpage}  be around tranquil and calm people. This will be very beneficial for you to 
develop your practice. Avoiding associating with people that are not calm, 
are not balanced, are not stable.

And lastly, we should incline our mind toward tranquility. We should 
be trying to incline our mind to quietness. While we are in the meditation 
center,  calm  down.  Lower  your  eyes,  lower  your  head.  Come  into  a  quiet 
zone by yourself. You will find that this is very beneficial for your sitting 
practice.  In  particular  we  want  to  be  in  the  present  moment,  tranquil  and 
calm. Holding the mind still and calm.

So this is the fifth enlightenment factor, passaddhi. Once piti and passaddhi have started to enter in your meditation scene, then the sixth enlightenment factor starts to be developed.


## Sixth enlightenment factor samadhi


The  sixth  enlightenment  factor  is  known  as
*samadhi*
.  It’s  normally
translated as concentration but I prefer the translation of
*stability*
. Stillness.
Samadhi is a factor of mind which lands on the object of observation 
and boroughs into it. Mindfulness penetrates the object, samadhi holds the 
mind there, keeps it still, stops the mind from leaving the scene. Mindfulness 
will bring us to the present, hold us in the present, penetrate the object so that 
we are there. When we do this continuously the mind stabilizes in this mode 
of operation. We call that samadhi or stillness or calmness. It’s a quietness 
of mind. It means that the mind sticks on the present object of observation. It 
sinks into it and it remains there with it so that it sees and knows things very 
clearly. Just like with the camera in the back of the truck, when it’s driving 
along and bouncing around, it’s difficult to get a clear image. So too, when 
the mind is still agitated and wandering, unstable with different thoughts and 
memories coming to create ripples on the surface of the water. Samadhi is 
that state of mind which will calm down the different mental factors. It also 
brings them together. It has this quality of pulling things together.

It has a characteristic of non-dispersal. Things don’t disperse or spreadout.  Things  are  coming  together,  concentrating.  But  this  word  of  concentration  is  often  misunderstood  as  a  state  of  intense  directiveness,  intense 
state of super-focusedness. But samadhi is a bit more than that. Our awareness [219]{.pdfpage}  can still be broad but our attention can be very still at the same time. 
Samadhi has this characteristic of non-scattering. It’s the mental factor that 
pulls the other mental factors in together. It brings the energy and mindfulness and investigation, the rapture and the tranquility, it pulls these mental 
states together, closer to consciousness. So it gets a more unified experience. 
That’s when insight starts to really arise. That’s when we start to see things 
as they really are – Vipassana-knowledge.

Its  function  is  to  bring  things  together,  collecting  the  mind  together. 
And that’s a translation that is sometimes used for samadhi – collectedness. 
Things are becoming collected.

There are many different types of samadhi. When we are talking about 
samadhi  today,  we  are  talking  about  the  enlightenment  factor  of  samadhi,
*samadhi bojjhanga*
. This leads to
*samma-samadhi*
, or noble right concentration. We  should  not  confuse  samadhi  with  other  types  of  samadhis. There 
are  many  different  samadhis  from  many  different  traditions.  Certainly  the 
hindu traditions have many different types of samadhi. The Buddha’s tradition does as well. In fact we’ll find that at the heart of most spiritual and religious traditions, there is some kind of samadhi involved. Some kind of collectedness, some kind of one-pointedness, some kind of stillness that leads 
to an experience of something. Normally, a unification of mind, normally, a 
oneness are some descriptions. We should be careful that we don’t take the 
definitions of other traditions and try to apply those definitions to the Buddha’s teaching. The definition of samadhi in the Buddha’s teaching is quite 
clear and it doesn’t need to be added to by other religious traditions, whether 
it be the desert fathers from the Christian tradition or by Meister Eckhart, 
or from the Islamic tradition, the Kabhala or from the Jewish tradition, the 
Hindu tradition or any of the indigenous cultures that have their own types 
of samadhi. Putting the mind in a state of internal one-pointedness is not a 
new thing for humans. We’ve been doing it for a very long time. Granted 
in our western culture we don’t pay any attention to it at all. It hasn’t been 
something we’ve been interested in. But that’s changing.

So be aware when we are talking about samadhi in this context, we are 
talking  about  a  very  specific  definition.  Not  the  kind  of  samadhis  that  are 
available in the various tantric traditions or the other meditative traditions. 
 [220]{.pdfpage}  This is a kind of samadhi we find explained in the Pali texts and practiced 
throughout the Buddha’s world.

The particular type of samadhi that we are after, is one that leads to 
insight. It’s the samadhi which co-joins with our awareness so that we penetrate and  see  the  three characteristics, the three general characteristics of 
all  physical  and  mental  phenomena.  This  is  where  our  samadhi  leads  to. 
This kind of samadhi has its bases in the four foundations of mindfulness. 
If you are developing your concentration based on the four foundations of 
mindfulness using real objects that arise – not conceptual objects, using real 
objects of mental and physical phenomena that are presently arising – then 
we start to develop the samadhi the Buddha is talking about. The samadhi 
that leads us to seeing things clearly, that allows wisdom to arise, wisdom 
into  the  three  characteristics  of  impermanence,  dukkha  and  non-self.  For 
sure it’s wisdom that sees these characteristics, but the proximate cause of 
wisdom is samadhi. And this is the kind of samadhi that we are developing. 
The one that happens quite calmly and automatically whilst we are developing the four foundations of mindfulness. We should take great care in ensuring that our mind is always open and feels spacious. We shouldn’t feel tight. 
It shouldn’t feel condensed, it shouldn’t feel tense, it shouldn’t be dark. It 
should be light, airy, open and spacious the feeling of being concentrated in 
the present moment. This type of concentration leads us to seeing things as 
they really are.

Of course, there is other types of samadhi practiced in the Buddha’s 
teaching  as  well.  There  are  various  states  of  liberation  and  various  states 
of  concentrations  using  both  ultimate  objects  and  conceptual  objects.  But 
the  particular  type  of  concentration  we  are  talking  about,  as  I  said,  is  this 
enlightenment factor of samadhi.

Vipassana practice is aimed at developing wisdom and the completion 
of  various  insights,  finally  arriving  at  equanimity,  developing  the  mind  to 
this seventh enlightenment factor. When we’re watching the rise and the fall 
of the abdomen, when we’re being mindful to the process of the movement, 
the  physical  sensations  that  are  arising,  with  each  moment  of  energy  and 
effort, you expand in cultivating the present moment awareness, there is a 
corresponding mental activity of penetrating the object. So we’re activating 
 [221]{.pdfpage}  and penetrating the present moment doing this over and over again until the 
mind stabilizes in this mode of watching. This is the type of samadhi that 
we’re after. The type of samadhi that stabilizes and is able to see the rise and 
fall of natural mental and physical phenomena. When it sees in this way, it 
will start to let them go. Wisdom will be activated and the letting go process 
begins. We start to purify our mind and body process. We start to purify the 
moment. We can have a state of purification from moment to moment. Our 
job  is  to  extend  that  out  as  much  as  we  can.  The  mind  becomes  purified 
because the hindrances can’t enter. Those defiled states are having troubles 
entering  our  experience  because  the  enlightenment  factors  have  taken  the 
place of the five hindrances and we’re on the road to development. Samadhi 
has the power to gather together all the other mental factors into a unified 
force  so  that  all  the  factors  can  do  their  job. They  are  all  arising  together 
and they are all ceasing together but they have their own jobs and their own 
functions. And we need to understand what these jobs and functions are and 
to make sure that we are developing them. Quite often people forget a few 
different factors and so we leave a few out. Our enlightenment factors are 
not fully developed and the faculties are not balanced. Wisdom is neglected, 
or extra energy is neglected, awareness is not penetrative, but concentration 
can  be  strong,  the  mind  just  becomes  still,  not  really  knowing  anything. 
Awareness and wisdom is unable to keep up with the state of concentration. 
So the mind just goes…it falls down a well. It stays there in stillness and 
happiness  and  a  little  bit  of  brightness.  It  stays  still  and  calm.  People  can 
become quite attached to this state of mind. In fact we can develop it that 
it becomes a very firm base for the arising of self. «I am a person that gets 
concentrated and here it is.» We can start to use that base of samadhi not for 
awareness and wisdom but as a foundation for the sense of self. We start to 
appropriate and identify with that state of samadhi. We believe we’ve got it! 
We are the owner of samadhi or we can do it or this is my samadhi! We start 
to identify with this state of stillness and calmness.

When we practice correctly with all the enlightenment factors developing, and when we are looking out for balancing the faculties, our awareness 
and wisdom will be able to keep up with each different stage of samadhi. As 
our samadhi deepens, our awareness and wisdom need to be sharp enough to 
 [222]{.pdfpage}  catch up. They need to be able to note and know every stage that the mind 
gets itself into. We need to note and know from the wandering stages, when 
we are in the past and future and wandering and thinking, we need to understand when the body is becoming uncomfortable through those stages, we 
need to understand when piti and tranquility are starting to arise. We need 
to  note  and  know  and  let  go  of  them  even  though  they  are  very  pleasant. 
We  need  to  stay  objective  towards  everything.  If  we  start  to  identify  with 
anything the object gets sucked in and becomes a story of self. So we need 
to  be  highly  alert,  highly  aware.  Be  on  the  lookout  for  any  stages  or  any 
platforms on which the sense of self can establish itself. It’s very tricky this 
craving! It’s been infiltrating and overcoming mental and physical states for 
a long time. So our job is to watch out where it may land even in our states 
of samadhi, even when the mind is becoming still. We still have to have a 
mind  that  is  non-attached.  In  fact,  as  we  develop  and  let  go,  develop  and 
let go, we realize that this is the only way for further development. To let 
go of what has already been achieved. To relinquish and let go and release 
ourselves even from deep states of concentration. This too has to be let go. 
The wisdom tells us. It’s nice, you can stay here for a while, but even this 
needs to be let go of.

Concentration is the proximate cause for the unfolding of wisdom. And 
once the mind is quiet and still, there is space for wisdom to arise. The gap, 
the space between the knowing and the physical and mental phenomena gets 
wider and wider to the point where we are not attaching to the mental and 
physical states as they arise and pass away.

The  Buddha  tells  us,  it’s  continuous  wise  attention  that  leads  to  this 
state of samadhi aimed at developing concentration. The aim of concentration is the cause of developing concentration. It works on itself. One stage of 
concentration leads to the next stage. So we have to incline our mind consistently to become stable – not only aware and present, but making our mind 
still and calm as well. And this happens over time. As we start to practice, we 
become more and more skillful at entering the state of calmness, maintaining 
our awareness there, and then, releasing the mind from the calmness, coming 
out. This is developed over time.


## [223]{.pdfpage}  First jhana


When these enlightenment factors are starting to be developed in this 
way, the stage of concentration starts to be developed. The eight factor of
the  noble  eightfold  path,  the  last  factor  is  samma-samadhi.  This
*samma-*
*samadhi*
has  four  parts  to  it.  The  first  jhana,  the  second  jhana,  the  third 
jhana  and  the  fourth  jhana.  These  are  stages  of  concentration  or  shall  we 
say, they are stages of letting go. This is how far and how much you have 
been able to let go. That determines those states of mind your samadhi is in. 
We said this week that our meditation practice is just the practice of letting 
go. When we’ve let go of thoughts of sensuality, when we’ve let go of the 
hindrances, when we’ve let go of the painful physical sensations that arise 
in the body, then we start to enter into the first jhana. And the Buddha gives 
us some directions on how to do this and what we should do when this state
arises. There is a case where,
*«a monk quite secluded from sensual pleasure, 
secluded from unwholesome states enters into and abides in the first jhana 
which has rapture and pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by applied*
*and sustained thought.»*
There are a few things in there:
 -

Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states – 
they have been let go of.

-

We develop initial and sustained application – this is direct thought and 
evaluative  thought. We  develop  these  in  our  meditation  practice. We 
are aiming and sustaining our attention on various objects. The «initial thought» to send the mind to the rise and the fall. The «sustained 
thought» to keep our mind right there. Initial and sustained application.

-

Piti starts to arise and happiness starts to arise.

These mind states are found in the first jhana. When this starts to happen, 
we become secluded, secluded from unwholesome states. The Buddha gives
us instructions on what to do with this:
*«He permeates, pervades, suffuses 
and  fills  this  very  body  with  the  rapture  and  pleasure  born  of  seclusion. 
There is nothing of the entire body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure*
*born of seclusion.»*
So when we notice that rapture or piti and happiness is 
starting  to  arise  in  our  meditation  practice,  the  Buddha’s  directions  are  to 
fill  the  body  with  this  rapture,  fill  the  mind  with  this  rapture.  Completely. 
Permeate, pervade, suffuse and fill – which is not fear these mental states! 
 [224]{.pdfpage}  The Buddha is telling us to directly use them, to contemplate it. He gives
us a simile:
*«Just as if a skilled bathman, or a bathman’s apprentice would 
pour bath powder into a brass basin with a little bit of water, kneading it 
together, sprinkling it with some water and so that the ball of bath powder 
would become wet, it would become saturated, moisture-ladden, permeated*
*within and permeated without, but would nevertheless not drip.»*
We got a 
ball of clothe-washing powder, if you like, made into a ball with a little bit 
of water. The ball is wet and moist, but it is not so wet and so moist that it 
falls apart. And that’s what we do with our body at the states of rapture and 
pleasantness when they start to arise. We don’t get all excited about it and 
start identifying with it. We don’t get excited and say, «oh I can do it». We 
don’t  start  to  subjectify  the  experience. And  we  also  don’t  become  scared 
of the experience. When the mind starts to become very, very still and the 
breath gets very, very short, becomes very quick, don’t get any fear. Don’t 
buy into the fear. If fear starts to arise in the mind, make a note of it: ‘worrying, worrying, scared, fear’, whatever word you like to use. Step away from 
that fear and allow the qualities of the samadhi experience to fill the mind 
and body process completely.

When we do this, we enter into the first jhana, the first jhana experience.  For  us  to  progress  any  further  from  this,  we’re  going  to  have  to  do 
some more letting go. When we let go, when we establish our awareness and 
we get to a stage of momentum where we don’t have to activate our awareness in the present and send it to the abdomen and sustain it at the abdomen 
– we’ve done that practice so often that the mind knows how to do it itself. It 
does it automatically. It can do it by itself to the stage of momentum, where 
we are still and present continuously in the present moment. When we get 
to this stage of observation, it becomes a little bit effortless. We don’t have 
to try so much. This particularly happens on longer retreats. Something after 
a month or two months, when we have been constantly activating and the 
mind knows what it’s doing it becomes automatic.


## [225]{.pdfpage}  Second jhana


We start to enter into a deeper state of samadhi, deeper concentration, 
when we let go of the directed and sustained thinking that’s needed to keep 
us in the present moment with the first jhana. When we let them go, then we
go into a more stable concentration. We enter into the second jhana.
*«And 
furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, he enters 
into and abides in the second jhana which has rapture and pleasure born of*
*concentration.»*
A unification of awareness which is free from directed and
evaluating thought. There is internal assurance or confidence.
*«He permeates, pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure 
born of concentration. There is nothing of the entire body unpervaded by the*
*rapture and pleasure born of concentration.»*


So in the second jhana we really start to experience samadhi. The rapture  and  pleasure  are  born  of  concentration.  In  the  first  jhana  the  rapture 
and  pleasure  are  born  of  seclusion.  There  is  a  certain  level  of  happiness 
from  being  secluded  from  the  hindrances.  As  soon  as  we  suppress  those 
hindrances our mind completely changes. The hindrances keep us busy with 
non-sense. Sensual desire, aversion, laziness, boredom, restlessness, worry 
and doubt. These five hindrances really block us. The first jhana is an experience of being secluded from them. The second jhana is an experience of 
being  secluded  from  initial  and  sustained  thinking.  We  don’t  need  to  use 
thinking in our meditation anymore. We become still. The mind has become 
concentrated and we start to see things as they really are. At this stage in our 
practice,  the  knowledge  of  arising  and  passing  away  becomes  quite  clear. 
We  see  mental  and  physical  phenomena  arising  and  passing  and  we  don’t 
hold on to them, we don’t identify with them. It’s just stuff that is arising and 
passing – very, very rapidly. And the mind settles in to a very nice state of 
observation. There is an internal assurance about that. We are quite confident 
in what we are doing. Be careful in this stage of the concentration practice, 
that you don’t become addicted to it. The piti can become very strong in this 
stage.  For  many  people  there  is  a  lot  of  light.  Light  is  shining  throughout 
the body coming out of the mind. Things are very calm and very peaceful. 
We feel an enormous amount of faith and confidence in the Buddha and his 
teaching. We think it’s miraculous and wonderful. There is a lot of strength 
 [226]{.pdfpage}  in the practice. At this stage we start to think, «well, it’s time to shave the 
head and become a nun or a monk». We start to really enjoy the practice and 
we start to see things as they really are.

The Buddha gives us a simile. He says,
*«just like a lake with spring 
water, welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north 
or south – the sky is periodically supplying some showers – so that a cool*
*font  of  water  would  be  welling  up  from  within.»*
It’s  coming  from  inside. 
There is a cool water coming to fill the lake, so that the cool water comes to
completely dominate the lake.
*«There being no part of the lake unpervaded 
by the cool water. So too, a monk pervades, suffuses, fills and permeates this*
*very  body  with  the  rapture  and  pleasure  born  of  concentration.»*
There  is 
nothing of the entire body unpervaded by this concentration.

So  this  is  the  second  jhana.  This  is  as  far  as  we  go  today  in  examining  this  enlightenment  factor  of  concentration.  Tomorrow  we’ll  start  to 
have  a  look  at  the  seventh  enlightenment  factor,  the  factor  of  equanimity 
or evenness. This factor of equanimity plays an important role in the third 
jhana and the fourth jhana. We’ll start to see how the development of these 
enlightenment  factors  and  their  completion  and  fulfillment,  fulfill  the  last 
factor of the noble eightfold path. The four jhanas come to completion when 
these  enlightenment  factors  have  been  successfully  developed.  When  the 
enlightenment factors are full and complete and stabilized, the fourth noble 
truth  arises.  It’s  the  path!  The  noble  eightfold  path  arises  in  the  mind  of 
the meditator. Right view is established, right attention is there, previously 
established right speech, right action and right livelihood, we’ve been putting forth effort and mindfulness continuously in the present so that the four 
jhanas start to arise. And this is how the eightfold path develops. We’ll talk 
more about that tomorrow.

For this morning I think that should be enough for us. We are going to 
continue with some walking mediation.
