# Afternoon Talk



It’s the last day, the last talk of our meditation retreat. All week we’ve 
been discussing the practice of satipatthana or the foundations of mindfulness. We’ve been practicing satipatthana putting it into practice in the present  moment,  developing  our  wisdom  in  the  present  moment.  We’ve  been 
listening to these talks. You’ve been doing the practice here in a secluded 
environment,  in  a  retreat  environment  where  we’ve  been  able  to  note  and 
know, start to see the functioning of our mind, even overcome some emotional states. We’ve all had the ability and the chance to overcome any resistance we may have experienced, overcome any emotional state or some kind 
of habitual thought pattern.

When we come out of the retreat, sometimes we have big expectations 
that somehow life is going to be miraculously transformed, we’re going to 
leave this place as a teflon-surfer and never be touched by anything again. 
We think we’ll deal skillfully with whatever comes our way. And we can and 
we will! There just may be some gaps in our awareness, when we leave here.
From  my  own  experience,  having  been  in  retreats  for  many  years, 
more than ten years, I found transitioning to the West quite difficult. A lot 
is thrown at you outside of the retreat environment. Training and practicing 
is one thing, having to deal with the stress and pressures of modern life is 
quite another. But the training does work. It works very well! It’s difficult 
 [267]{.pdfpage}  to implement and it’s difficult to make solid progress when we have a very 
busy life style, but it’s not impossible. And it’s very possible to transform 
our daily life in a very meaningful way. This teaching can be used in a very 
meaningful way to change our expectations of life and to also allow us to not 
get caught up so much in the stories of our mind, get caught up in the stories 
of our imagination, get caught by craving – that’s what we’re getting caught 
by. We  can’t  expect  to  go  on  living  the  way  we’ve  been  living  thinking  a 
little bit of dhamma is going to fix everything. We’ll just incorporate some 
mindfulness and everything will be fine, all our problems will be solved. It 
rarely works like this! There’s always some adjustment to our lifestyle that’s 
to be made if we want to make progress on the path. Certain activities to be 
let go of, certain people to be let go of. Certain things to be developed, certain practices to be done, association with people – these are all things that 
need to be developed.

How far you want to take this is up to you! You can choose how far 
and  how  fast  you  want  to  walk  the  path. This  week  we’ve  been  detailing 
some instructions, not only on the basic practices but on the full development of the path practicing in a very intense fashion. Noting and knowing, 
letting go, developing our awareness continuously, persistently, overcoming 
any doubts. Brushing away any boredom or laziness, not reacting to sensual 
desire or ill will, trying to calm the restless mind.

We’ve  been  working  hard. You’ve  all  been  working  very  well. Very 
pleased with the way you’ve been working this week.

Some of you have expressed some interest in wanting to know how we 
can put this teaching here, which we have been following, into our daily life. 
I’ll talk about that in a moment. But the path we’ve been explaining here is 
not impractical. Yes, I realize you have a busy life. We know that you won’t 
be able to meditate for 17 hours a day every day in your normal daily life. 
We are aware of that.

So there needs to be some adjustment to the training and to your expectations. We’ve been delivering a very high level meditation technique to you 
here this week. It leads us to removing gross levels of dukkha and takes us
all the way to full and final liberation from samsara.
*The entire training is*
*contained in this teaching.*
How far you want to develop that is going to be 
 [268]{.pdfpage}  up to you! It’s your choice.

Given some of you are playing football. It’s your choice. If you like 
to play football, you can decide «I like to play football in the park with my 
friends after work». And that’s a level of football you might be comfortable 
with. If you really like chasing balls, well you can go to the local club. Join 
the team. Maybe they train once a week and have a game, a social game, 
a social match on the weekend. You can train at that level if you want to. 
Bring football into your life a little bit more, a more serious level. If you’re 
really into it, you can go to a higher league, maybe try out for the state team. 
Maybe you want to try to get into the national team or the olympic team. 
Then you have to start training more regularly. You have to start taking care 
of your diet, you have to start going to the gym for your muscle development,  you  have  to  start  listening  to  training  advises  and  training  videos. 
You’ll have to start training! You’ll have to start practicing, practicing with 
the senior players, developing your skill. You can take it to this level, the 
state level. If you really want to get going, if you’re really into football, then 
you can try to get in one of the premier leagues. It depends how much you 
like football. How far are you willing to train? That’s for each person to be 
decided for themselves.

It’s  up  to  you!  The  information  has  been  delivered.  The  teaching  is 
there. You’re all intelligent enough to be able to listen and to focus on the 
teaching. How far do you really understand it? Do you know what needs to 
be done? Has this sunk in? Or, you’re just looking for something that’s going 
to cure some little problems in your life and then go on as normal. That’s 
fine  too.  The  Buddha’s  teaching  is  for  people  who  want  to  practice  at  all 
different levels. You don’t have to become a nun, shave your head and live 
in the forest in a cave. Although you can! I know there’s a few of you thinking about it. Maybe the guys don’t want to become nuns, you can become 
monks.

You can decide that for yourself. In fact, while we’re talking about it, 
I encourage you. Be careful for what you wish for. A period of training as a 
monk or a nun can be very rewarding. It’s not compulsory to become a monk 
or a nun for the rest of your life. It’s a period of training in the Buddha’s 
teaching. A time we go in for intensive training. We don’t have to do it for 
 [269]{.pdfpage}  ever. It’s very beneficial.

So we can choose to live very simply by dharmic principals. We can 
maintain  our  level  of  virtue.  Difficult  sometimes  in  our  social  lives.  Our 
social activities are leading us sometimes into different directions. We can 
also watch our intentions. Be aware of your intentions! Is your mind filled 
with intentions of renunciation, loving kindness and compassion or are you 
leaning  toward  accumulation,  getting,  achieving,  becoming?  Have  a  look 
at that. Know, one leads to happiness and the other leads to dukkha. Have 
a look a your intentions. Use wise attention on a daily basis to examine the 
motivations, the reasons and the causes for what you want to do, for what 
you are doing.

If  you  need  to  make  a  decision,  examine  it. What  are  the  criteria  on 
which you are you’re making your decision making? Examine that. Exam-
ine your motivations. Try to see things. Well,
*there’s two choices: this one 
is beneficial and wholesome to many people and this one is just greedy for*
*myself*
. You have a choice! Have a think about it! Choose what is wholesome 
not  what  is  unwholesome,  what  is  positive,  what  is  not  negative.  Choose 
something suitable and beneficial. If you’re going through a life transition, 
if you are turning your life around wondering to make a new start, a new 
career, something, a new job – when you’re thinking about that, when you’re 
planning that, use wise attention. Have a look what kind of person you want 
to  be  in  society.  If  you  need  to  make  a  job  change  or  career  change,  and 
everything’s  open  to  you  and  you’re  not  quite  sure,  then  you  can  choose 
something that’s beneficial for others.

Yes,  of  course,  you’ll  be  able  to  make  a  livelihood  from  it. You  can 
make some money as well. You have to support yourself. Everybody does. 
The Buddha certainly agreed with that. That’s why right livelihood is the fifth 
factor of the noble eightfold path. We have to earn our livelihood in a honest 
and in a way with integrity. Truthfulness. When we need to make decisions 
about these things, choose a job that’s going to be beneficial for others, not 
just a job that’s going to get you more money. Money’s not the big criteria 
here. Money comes and money goes. Sometimes it’s around, sometimes it’s 
not.  Don’t  orientate  your  life  towards  the  collection  of  money.  That’s  not 
what we’re here for. If you do a good job and you’re a reasonable person, 
 [270]{.pdfpage}  money is going to be coming in. That’s fine.

We’ve  been  saying  all  week,  that  the  Buddha’s  teaching  is  about 
removing the sense of self from the picture, erasing the ego taking things as 
not «mine», not «I», not «myself». We need to understand that selfishness 
needs to be reduced if suffering is to be reduced. Happy people are the ones 
that have reduced their sense of self to the point where they’re doing things 
for others. Not only for money, but they’re doing things because they like 
to give.

We also need to understand that any situation that we find ourselves in 
is a presentation of the manifestation of our old karma. Everything is arising 
through cause and condition. There is nothing that happens by coincidence. 
Everything  is  happening  for  a  reason.  It  has  conditions.  If  there  is  certain 
conditions in place, this is what we experience. Don't appropriate that experience. Stop holding on to it as being «me» or «mine». Brush it off, let it go. 
Things happen to us. Someone abuses you or is rude to you, don’t hold on 
to that by hating them – you cause yourself a lot of dukkha. Laugh it off! 
Let it go! The Buddha said, we should be like the earth if someone speaks 
rudely  to  us.  The  earth  doesn’t  respond  if  someone  pours  dirty  liquid  on 
it or abuses it in some way. Make your mind like the earth! Make it sand! 
Whatever liquid you’re going to pour into it, it’s just going to disappear. Let 
it run through. It goes in one ear, and out the other. That used to be a term 
of abuse. It’s great when it does that! Perfect! We don’t have to hold on to 
any  non-sense  speech.  Somebody  says  something  rude  –  through  it  goes. 
Straight through to the keeper.

So, in our daily lives, we can bring in the dhamma in quite a few ways, 
many different ways. The most obvious one is to do some sitting meditation. 
Organize yourself a place and a time to do some sitting meditation. The time 
of the day is sometimes tricky to organize when we’re social, when we have 
jobs, when we’re busy, when we’re traveling especially. I suggest you find a 
time in the morning some time when the demands of the family and friends 
or the boss is not upon you. Early in the morning – great! Get up half an 
hour earlier. Set yourself a goal how long you want to sit and do it. Try not to 
start too long. When you leave here, you’re going to be doing three hours in 
the morning and three hours in the night, hmmm. Don’t start with such high 
 [271]{.pdfpage}  goals or priorities. Just start with 20 minutes or half an hour. If it’s a good 
sitting you can sit longer. The way I started sitting was by using an incensestick. It takes about 45 minutes. That’s your effort for the morning. Be aware 
with this technique, however, you may end up with a little bit of a winker, 
always looking at the incense, seeing whether it’s finished or not. Try to use 
your nose, that’s also functioning. You all know that joy. We used to have a 
clock in this room, I took it out!

So, setting up yourself to have a sitting practice is a good idea. Try to 
find a place at home. If you have a special place, if you can devote a whole 
room even better! If you can’t find a room, find a corner of a room. Get a 
sitting  mat  and  place  it  there.  That’s  the  place  you’re  going  to  meditate. 
And  make  a  time  to  do  that.  Have  a  little  corner.  If  you  like  candles  and 
incense, by all means do that. And be strict with it. The most difficult thing 
of  establishing  a  sitting  meditation  practice  is  just  actually  sitting  down. 
Once you start sitting it’s fine. You’ve crawled down to the floor and folded 
your legs and sat down. It’s fine. It’s just walking over to the mat and sitting 
down  that’s  quite  often  the  difficulty.  Find  a  time.  Evenings  can  be  often 
interrupted by social activities. Meal preparation and such things. Once our 
schedule gets busted a few times, it’s hard to get it re-established again. We 
go from seven days a week down to three days a week and then occasionally 
to a couple of times a month and then to zero. And I’ll see you back here in 
a year. Come for a retune. Yes, welcome back, people.

So find a place. Even better in our cities, in our towns these days are 
many sitting groups. You can find them online. Find a meditation group to 
join. It doesn’t have to be this type of meditation practice. Just as long as 
they  meet  together  and  they  sit  in  silence. You  can  do  your  own  practice. 
This has many benefits. The group energy that we’ve been experiencing here 
this week pulling us all to the hall. You can feel what a good group energy is 
like. Everybody’s coming. Ok, everyone else is doing it, so I have to do it. I 
better take myself along. It’s a good incentive. I very much doubt, if I said, 
ok, meditate so many hours in your room, that you’ll be doing it by yourself. 
Come and do it as a group. So join a group. You may meet some new and 
interesting people as well. It’s good to meet some dhamma friends. The ven-
erable Ananda once said to the Buddha:
*«Venerable sir, the holy life, associ-*
*ating with good friends, paleana mitta, is half of the holy life.»*
[272]{.pdfpage}   The Buddha
said,
*«Oh, Ananda, do not say so. Do not say so. This holy life is one hundred*
*percent  lived  with  good  friends.»*
So  find  yourself  some  good  friends  that 
can not only lead you along the path but be your companion upon the path. 
Introduce  it  to  your  existing  friends  or  find  some  new  friends. You’ll  find 
that sitting groups often end up becoming quite social. It’s a bit of meditation, it’s a lot of coffee drinking, an enormous amount of gossip and chatter 
and we’ll see you next week. And you have some new friends on Facebook. 
So join a group if you can find one. There are monasteries all over the place. 
There are meditation centers. There are Vipassana centers. Different styles 
and different techniques. You’ve learned one of the techniques here. It’s the 
technique on which all the other techniques are built, the satipatthana. They 
all come from the same source. Slightly different approach in some ways but 
pretty much the same.

You can also do meditation around the town. Many of us have to take 
public transport when we go to work. Ok, maybe chanting is a little bit too 
much for the train but you can certainly meditate. Find yourself a place, sit 
down – don’t sit down cross legged on the floor of the train or bus, it may be 
a little weird – sit on a chair, close your eyes, bring the attention to yourself. 
Loving  kindness  practice  is  really  wonderful.  Sit  in  the  train  with  all  the 
‘happy’ people at 7.30 and see the ‘happiness’ all over their face if they go to 
work. You can smile, radiate. I warn you about the slow walking meditation. 
That may be a little bit too much. You may have some authorities coming to 
visit you. «Are you okay, sir?» Just answer them really slowly, «yeeaahh». 
So we can do that on the train. We can do that on the bus. When you 
go to a place with many, many people, a big shopping mall or a big sporting 
field, a big train station, radiate loving kindness. Imagine all those people. 
Just send them your love.

Mostly our practice at home will be some form of maintenance practice 
where we maintain our development. We have some good sittings, some are 
a bit boring. But basically we are just maintaining as we go along. Developing, strengthening the practice, taking it to the level that we already have, 
becoming fluent with the meditation. We are practicing. And when we want 
to go a little bit deeper, when we feel that we have stalled a little bit, then we 
 [273]{.pdfpage}  can come and do a retreat. Seven days like this or longer retreats. 20 days, 
two months, seven months, three years. As you like. And you can make some 
rapid development. You will lose all your friends, but you will be quite wise. 
So do some retreats. Bring them into your life. There are lots of them around 
the world. Get some dhamma friends. This is very useful for our practice.

Mostly the practice is done, however, not just in half an hour sitting 
sessions. The real practice is done on a daily basis not on an hourly basis. 
We all face unwanted situations from time to time. We all lose our balance 
from  time  to  time.  We  generate  negativity  in  different  ways  when  we  are 
triggered. And we always look for an external cause. «That is what did it. It 
was him. It was that. That was the problem.» We start to blame others but the 
problem is not there. Because the problems is in here, it's in our own mind 
and body process. So be prepared to confront your reaction patterns. This is 
what we do with the dhamma in our daily life. Try to bring and activate your 
awareness of the present moment into your daily life. 20 minutes or half an 
hour sitting in the morning is one type of practice. Bring your awareness of 
the present moment even just 20 or 30 seconds, even just a minute an hour. 
That's when we start to get the practice rolling. It is in reminding ourselves 
– this is another aspect of the word sati, it means remembrance or bringing 
to memory, recollection. We are reminding ourselves to practice. Regularly. 
You  should  be  able  to  bring  your  yourself  into  the  present  moment  for  at 
least a few moments every hour. Put aside some time. Find those activities 
where you find yourself waiting.

A good one to do is when you are having a cup of tea or a cup of coffee. 
You made the tea, it's in the cup, it's too hot to drink, put it on the table and 
just wait a few minutes. Cool down, bring yourself into the present moment 
and start noting. See what's there, see what's in your mind. Check your attitude. See how things are. Contemplate your reactions. Have you made a mistake? Do you need to apologize? Did you let yourself go some way? Bring 
yourself back! Overcome any emotional state that you may have for the day. 
Overcome any issues that you may have with a person. Clear it up. Don't let 
it fester in the mind. Festering is what causes a lot of dukkha, especially in 
relationships with people, especially in the work environment.

Work is one of those strange things you have to go and spend eight, ten 
 [274]{.pdfpage}  or 12 hours with people that we wouldn't normally hang out with. And yet 
we have to be with them very closely throughout the day. At times this can 
cause problems and we bring those problems home into our personal life.

Deal  with  those  problems  as  they  come  up.  Don't  have  a  collection 
of  ill  will  or  animosity  to  different  people  here  and  there.  Don't  burn  any 
bridges. It makes sure everything is kept comfortable. Make an effort to do 
that. If you're not a person that usually forgives and apologizes, if you have 
an ego that won't allow you, pride that doesn’t allow you to do that, then start 
working with that. Start to see that as a dukkha-inducer. This causes dukkha 
in your life. Free your mind from that. Work with it. Be on the lookout in 
your daily life for things that you need to work on. We all have our own little 
things.  Some  get  angry,  some  get  lusty,  some  get  irritated,  but  then  calm 
down very quickly, some get super angry and then very, very polite, some 
people get all cravy, lusty and addicted. Craving comes in nice and strong 
really affecting their mind. Have a look at that stuff. Patience needs to be 
developed. All  these  things  can  be  developed. That  is  what  the  training  is 
about. You will need to be intelligent and skillful to bring the practice into a 
busy Western lifestyle. Of course, it's different if you live here. Things are a 
bit easier. You don't have so much to deal with but the mind still reacts. You 
will have to deal with people, places and things. You still have to become 
cool towards them under any circumstance or situation.

So  have  a  look  at  your  reactions.  Try  to  work  with  that.  Work  with 
your sitting meditation. Make your awareness more stable. Do your walking meditation. It doesn't have to be the formal, four stage, super slow walk. 
You  can  do  it  walking  your  dog  around  the  park.  Walking  on  the  beach, 
walking in the forest, walking to work. You can do all those things. You can 
even try meditating on the bicycle. I tried it. It's kind of okay. You can really 
pay attention to only one foot though as it doesn't stop. It just keeps going 
around.

So  that's  a  few  things  that  we  can  do,  a  few  orientations.  When  we 
go  back  home,  find  places,  find  a  group,  go  to  a  temple.  In  various  cities 
around  the  world,  there  are  ‘conscious-events’,  where  people  meet  with 
other  conscious  people. You  will  find  many  interesting  people  there.  New 
fellow travelers on the path. Those beings who are seeking evolution, seeking [275]{.pdfpage}   transformation,  seeking  to  remove  their  defilements.  Not  those  beings 
who are blinded by following simply the path of sensuality, sensual pleasure. 
Or simply just chasing money, because that’s all anyone ever told them to 
do. «The job is to get money.» Off you go. So there is lots of different groups 
out there.


## The ten pāramī


In the Buddha’s tradition, there are what is known as the ten
*pāramī*
or 
the 10 perfections. These are also qualities that we can develop in our daily 
life. Those of you who have been around Thailand a little bit, you’ll have 
seen  that  in  many  of  the  Buddha  halls,  there  is  various  paintings  around 
the inside of the hall. Often these paintings are depictions of the previous 
10 lives of the Buddha before he became fully enlightened. In each of the 
10 lives, before the Buddha was fully enlightened, he perfected a particular 
mind state. And these have come down to us and are known as the 10 perfections. The 10 things that need to be perfected before one becomes a fully self 
awakened Buddha.

These are qualities of mind. Behaviors that should be developed. In the 
northern Buddhist tradition, they have six pāramīta. It's just a few elements 
joined together from 10 to 6.

So we can try to develop these pāramī. Take this list of pāramī and put 
them on the fridge. Observe them. Think about what you're going to practice 
today. What am I going to do today?
1.

The  first  perfection  is  known  as
*dāna*
.  Dāna  means  generosity  or 
giving  or  sharing.  It  means  giving  something  of  oneself.  Letting  go 
even. Being generous and helpful both financially and with your time 
and with your efforts. Try to perfect this. Try to bring this behavior into 
your  life.  Be  generous!  Share! When  you  have  a  meal,  share  it  with 
someone. Try to incline your mind towards giving and sharing. This 
is a very wholesome quality, which has incredibly wonderful benefits. 
The results of that giving. The results of that karma hundred fold some 
say. So become a generous person.
2.

The second pāramī is
*sīla*
, or virtue or morality. Try to maintain a 
level of virtue. Virtuous behavior, virtuous speech. Try to avoid those 
 [276]{.pdfpage}  3. 
4.

unwholesome things. Killing and stealing, lying. Don't take anybody 
else's partner or lover. We don't need to commit adultery. We don't need 
to cause difficulties and troubles for other people. Try to avoid intoxicants that lead to heedlessness, that lead to drunk and stupid foolishness. Try to avoid these things. Be well disciplined and well refined in 
your manners. Clean and pure in your dealings with others. Don't try 
to cheat anyone or rip anyone off. Be honest and straightforward. May 
your thoughts and actions and speech be purified.

The third pāramī is
*nekkhama*
or renunciation or letting go. We are 
developing the state of mind that inclines towards letting go. It's leaning towards relinquishing. Going forth from the home into the homeless life. Letting go of our addictions. Letting go of our attachments, 
our  collections  of  things.  Moving  forward.  Clearing  things  out.  Not 
hoarding. Not holding. Not being tied to stuff. Letting go of things. Not 
being selfish and possessive of things. Being selfless and disinterested. 
These things don't belong to ourselves. Don't hold on to them. Holding 
them leads to dukkha. If we hold on to them tightly and they change 
– dukkha. If they disappear – dukkha. If they get damaged – dukkha. 
Recognize that the act of holding leads to dukkha. And the act of letting go leads to freedom and release. You're not going to be happy and 
free, if you try to collect a whole lot of stuff. If you're trying to walk 
into two opposite directions, you won't get very far!

The fourth pāramī is
*pañña*
or wisdom. Here we are talking about 
perfecting our own knowledge about our mind and body process. Becoming wise as to this thing whatever is going on in it. Physical sensations  and  feelings,  perceptions,  thoughts  and  emotions. All  kinds  of 
states of knowing. Pañña, it's light. It's the light and the truth. Try to 
bring more and more wisdom into your life. Activate your awareness 
in the present moment and see what's there. Try to develop your wisdom in some way. You can read, you can discuss dhamma. But most 
importantly you should practice dhamma. You need to experience the 
teaching for yourself. It's through experiencing it in an intensive way, 
that transformation takes place.
5.

The fifth perfection is
*viriya*
or energy. We have spoken about that 
 [277]{.pdfpage}  6.

this week. The perfection of energy. Make sure you are vigorous in all 
your activities and energetic. Be perseverant. Don't give up. Don't give 
up on the commitment that you have made. Finish what you start. Do 
the job properly. Don't be slack, don't be lazy even if it takes extra time. 
Put in the extra effort. You will be well rewarded. Effort is always rewarded. When we put forth effort, we feel good for ourselves, we know 
that we've done the best that we can do, and others around us, that support us, that help us, they also see it. They see you putting forth effort 
and energy. So they come to help us as well. There's many benefits of 
putting forth effort. Be fearless in the face of dangers. Courageously 
surmount all obstacles.

The  sixth  perfection  is
*kanthi*
.  It  means  patience.  Patience  is  the 
highest practice. It's the highest tapas – not the Spanish tapas, but the 
Pali tapas. Tapas is a spiritual practice that leads to removing of defilements. In India it’s still practiced by some saddhus and rishis. They try 
to inflict damage onto their body in the idea to develop a lot of dukkha 
and experiencing a lot of dukkha, they will be able to come to the other 
side faster. It is a misguided belief that we have a vast store of dukkha 
to  experience  and  if  we  experience  it  quickly  and  completely  in  one 
life,  then  we  break  free  of  our  dukkha.  That's  not  how  the  Buddha 
teaches things. Dukkha is conditioned. The Buddha’s teaching is about 
removing the conditions. When we remove the conditions for the arising of self, self doesn't arise. When self doesn't arise, dukkha doesn't
arise. It's the wonderful thing about
*stream-entry*
. When you reach the 
first path of enlightenment, when we have entered the stream, it cuts
off so many causes and conditions.
*It cuts off identity view*
, we talked 
about the other day. Sakaya diti. The path of stream entry cuts off iden-
tity view and self no longer arises.
*When self no longer arises, then the 
billions of karma that we have done, most of them don't have a chance*
*to come up.*
We have cut off the pathway. We've blocked the pathway 
for the arising of old karma. It’s conditioned stuff. We have cut off the 
sense of self. The sense of self was the thing that those karmas could 
manifest  by. A  maximum  of  seven  life  times. The  Buddha  was  once 
sitting  with  the  monks,  put  his  fingernail  into  this  dirt,  picked  it  up

and asked:
*[278]{.pdfpage}  «Monks, what is more. The soil in my fingernail or the soil 
of this great earth?» «Oh, venerable sir. The soil of this great earth is 
enormous and massive. It can't be properly measured and quantified. 
And  the  soil  in  your  fingernail  is  such  a  trifling,  tiny  little  peace.  It 
hardly even compares.» «So too, monks. So too, those beings who have 
not yet achieved stream entry, have as much karma as the earth has 
soil to go. And those beings who have entered the stream, have only*
*this much dukkha to experience.»*
So I encourage you, to put forth effort and your patience to reach the path of stream entry, the first stage 
of  enlightenment.  Very  doable  in  this  life.  There  are  people  around 
this  country  and  in  other  countries,  that  have  done  it,  that  have  broken through and become stream-enterers. We all have that opportunity. 
We are all blessed with the supreme opportunity. There is 34 million 
tourists coming to Thailand every year. That is two million a month! 
Here we just get 50! You are 50 out of 2 million. You come here for a 
reason. Beings are related through their karma. We are related through
something.
*«Through an element is monks, that beings come together 
and meet together. Beings of virtuous tastes flowing together, meeting 
together the beings of virtuous tastes. As it has been in the past, as it*
*will be in the future, as it is now in the present.»*
Beings come together 
because they share an element. It draws them together like a magnet. 
They stay for as long as the karma is powerful and then they separate. 
This is not something that is unusual. This is just the way things are. 
This is how things are functioning. So be aware of that in the connections that you make with people. Look out for those connections that 
can be very beneficial for your spiritual development. When you meet 
someone who seems to be very present, hang out with them for a while. 
See what they have to share. What they have to offer. Patience. Be able 
to bear or forbear the wrongs of others. When somebody does something nasty, we can handle that. That is what patience is. It's not just 
being patient standing in the queue at the post office or bank, that’s just 
waiting. That's our opportunity to practice a little bit of standing meditation. Become aware of the whole standing posture. The feet touching 
the  ground.  Instead  of  pulling  out  your  iPhone  starting  to  swipe  and

check, seeing what kind of cupcake your best friend had for breakfast, 
bring  your  awareness  to  the  present  moment.  Don't  spend  your  time 
on  foolish  nonsense.  Don't  waste  your  life.  It's  precious  the  time.  If 
you have any time spare, be present. See how it changes your outlook 
to  things.  See  how  it  de-stresses  you.  You  may  become  completely 
chilled out and move to Koh Phangan permanently.

The  seventh  perfection  is
*sacca*
or  truth. Truthfulness.  Be  honest 
and truthful who you are, what you're doing. Make sure what you say 
is truthful. Honest. Don't hide the truth just to be polite. Develop your 
integrity in your speech. When you say you're going to do something, 
do it. When you say you're going to do something by a certain time, do 
it. Sometimes things get in the way but try to adhere to that principal. 
Try to be an honest, upstanding person. A right kind of person in the 
community. If you find something, hand it in. Be that person. Don't be 
a selfish person. Don't swerve from the path of truth.

The eighth perfection is
*adiṭṭhāna*
, meaning resolution or determination. Be resolute. Don't let your resolutions become like your New 
Year's  resolutions.  Finished  by  February,  forgotten  by  March. Try  to 
keep up your practices, the things you do. Have a mind which is resolute and firm and yet soft, gentle and pliable. Set your goal and work 
towards it. Complete your tasks. Have your principals if you like – just 
don't attach to them.

The  ninth  perfection  is
*mettā*
or  loving  kindness.  We  have  been 
practicing  it  all  week. That  special  intention  that  we  radiate  to  other 
beings wishing them to be happy. Filling our mind with the strong wish 
and  desire  for  other  beings  to  be  happy.  It’s  a  wonderful  way  to  get 
around. It's a wonderful way to live. If you have any spare time, incline 
your mind towards loving kindness. Be friendly and compassionate to 
others. See what difference it makes in your life. Be friendly and smiling to people that you come across. Show your love, your compassion 
for other beings.

The tenth pāramī, we talked about this morning.
*Upekkha*
, equanimity. 
The development of equanimity. Calmness, peacefulness, balance. The 
balanced mind. The mind that is in the center, neither swaying left nor

[280]{.pdfpage}  right. Neither getting upset nor reacting with attachment or aversion, 
with liking or disliking. It's the mind that can stand still. It's the big tree 
during the cyclone or hurricane. It doesn't get uprooted or thrown on 
the ground like a bag of toothpicks. It stands solid. This is what equanimity can do for us. We can handle any situation that is going on.

Develop  these!  These  aren't  things  that  just  automatically  happen. 
These are things that we can develop every single day. You can choose any 
of these perfections and try to develop them. You can choose one a day. You 
can choose one per week if you like. Really try to focus on developing that. 
Really bring those qualities of mind into your life. You will find that these 
qualities are really wonderful for your meditation practice. In fact, here in 
Thailand, if you start meditating and your results come fast and quickly, the 
monks and nuns will say you have good pāramī. You have good perfections. 
These are like little bank accounts that we are trying to fill up. Our practice 
develops as our perfections are fulfilled. The more perfections that we are 
doing,  the  better  our  meditation  is  going  to  be.  These  are  states  of  mind 
which orientate us to letting go, to calmness, to stillness, to seeing things as 
they really are. We can develop these pāramī.

So these ten perfections, we try to develop them in our life. We try to 
get them going. Develop them as much as you can! So this is a further set 
of practices that you can do whilst at home. That will be beneficial for your 
dhamma life. Putting in place a strong foundation of dhamma life, is what 
we really need for our meditation practice to get deeper and deeper. We can 
go only so far with a certain lifestyle. After that, if we want to get deeper 
into the state of peace, we have to start to make some changes. Changes that 
affect our mind, that affect our outlook on things.

So talking of the 10 perfections, there will be a chance for you to practice the first one tomorrow when you can give a donation. This meditation 
center  here  operates  on  a  donation  basis.  When  you’re  giving  something 
tomorrow you're not paying for something, but think of it that you’re making 
a gift of dhamma for others to receive. Someone else can experience it just 
like you have. Happily and freely we give a gift of dhamma so that others 
may experience it. This dāna that we’re doing here is of very profound and
very deep meaning.
*«The gift of dhamma excels all other gifts.»*

[281]{.pdfpage}  Your opportunity to give a donation of dhamma is an extremely powerful karma. One of this potentiality that you haven't come across before. The 
strength and quality of it, karma, is measured by four things. It's measured 
by the purity of the giver, the purity of the receiver, the quality of the gift 
and  the  intention  behind  the  gift.  The  purity  of  the  giver,  that  is  you,  is 
great. You just have been meditating for seven days. Your mind has become 
purified somewhat. At least the hindrances have been suppressed for some 
period this week. We have been taking the eight precepts which is kind of the 
maximum for lay people. So we’re developing our sīla. The quality on the 
virtue of the giver is very high. The people that will receive your donation 
next month, their sīla will also be very high. The gift that you are giving, the 
gift of dhamma, well, the Buddha says no other gift excels it. It's the highest,  most  profound  gift,  that  you  can  give  to  somebody. And  then  all  that 
remains is your intention. I want you to spend some time tomorrow, making
an intention.
*«May this gift be for the gift of dhamma. May this gift be for*
*other beings to realize the teaching.»*
Really do intend that. Make a strong 
intention. I encourage you to even write it on the envelope to put it in concrete terms. In this way your donation, your gift will have the strongest possible benefit that you can imagine. This type of karma is the type of karma 
that brings us back to find the dhamma again. You have given dhamma. So 
you’re going to receive the dhamma in return in this life and in the next lives. 
You will come back and you’ll meet the Buddha’s teaching. You won't be 
lost in a sea of samsara swirling in the rounds of rebirth. This type of karmic 
intention is very powerful. So we hope you take the opportunity to do that. 
Everyone  has  their  own  means.  How  much  you  give  is  up  to  you.  Don't 
be  stingy.  Give  with  an  open  heart.  Give  just  enough  that  it  hurts  a  little 
bit. Don't make yourself broke. So have a good think about that tomorrow 
morning when the opportunity arises. I can't emphasize this enough. Really 
incline your mind to giving the gift of dhamma so that other beings may can 
become enlightened. This is a supreme gift that you can give in your life. It 
will be extremely beneficial for you.
