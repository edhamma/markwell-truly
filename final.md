# Final words



So we have been practicing the noble eightfold path. We have practiced 
it in the moment. This is the only place we can practice it. If we don't practice now, when are we going to practice? This is the only chance we have to 
see things as they are. Now! Now is the time we need to activate our awareness in the present moment. We are practicing the path. Even in the action 
of hearing. When hearing occurs, there is right view when we haven't gone 
into the story of ‘I am listening to something’. When we’re back and ‘there 
is hearing’. Two very different circumstances. Physically it’s the same thing 
going on. Sound is vibrating on the ear drum. ‘I am listening’ takes place. 
But  if  we  are  aware  and  present  in  the  moment  ‘there  is  hearing’  taking 
place. Two sides of a coin. One of them leads to dukkha. One of them leads 
to release. One of them is a manifestation of being in the sense perception 
process. The other one is a manifestation of freedom in the present moment. 
So we practice in this way. We notice what is there in the present moment, 
we  know  what's  there,  we  step  away  from  it.  This  is  our  right  view. And 
right view comes first. We understand that this is just nature. «There is …». 
That will be the phrase that will be very helpful to you. Whenever you find 
yourself being attacked by something, sadness or grief or anger or aversion, 
«there is …». Feel it for yourself! Observe it! Note it! Don’t get sucked into 
it. Don't get playing in the content of your mind. Step back and see the structure, [283]{.pdfpage}  so the content can be let go of. We don't hold on to it.

We know that objects are just objects. Nature is just nature. We know 
that  experiences  are  just  experiences.  They  are  not  happening  to  anyone. 
It's just experience. There is no experiencer. There's nobody here. We have 
the right attitude and the right intention. We are letting go and renouncing 
things. Our effort is in the present. Our awareness is in the present. We have 
been able to stabilize the mind so that we can note and know continuously. 
So our concentration is there. These five factors of the path are developed 
in a single moment of noting, knowing and letting go. We have previously
already  established  right  speech,  right  action  and  right  livelihood.
*So  the 
noble  eightfold  path  is  practiced  in  the  present.  It  arises  in  the  present.*
Dhamma is ever present. There is dhamma-talk everywhere. You don't have 
to listen to me to realize or listen to the dhamma. It's talking to us all around 
us. Nature is teaching us but we are often unable to hear. We are not paying 
attention to the present. We have been distracted by the past, future or our 
iPhones. We  can't  know  or  see  dhamma  because  of  the  defilements  in  the 
mind. If we can think and see nature as it really is, then the mind is free. Free 
from the defilements and there is nature everywhere. We are free in the present moment. All we need to do is extend that moment out, make it regular, 
make it arise often. Bring yourself into that moment as much as you can. We 
are training the mind to be in that moment. To be in that mode of observation. It's one thing to get into it on a retreat. It's another practice to keep it 
up.  Keep  opening  your  heart.  Keep  opening  your  mind,  your  awareness, 
your wisdom in the present and seeing what’s there not being upset. Accepting. We are accepting! We have to accept! We are trying to think in the right 
way  and  we’re  trying  to  be  aware.  We're  not  complaining  about  what  is 
happening. It is as it is. Karma is unfolding. Acceptance is very important. 
If we don't have right view and we don't have right intention, we won't be 
able to accepting whatever is happening in the present moment. When we 
don't accept, we start to react. When we start to react, we start to dukkher 
ourselves. So we need to accept things. Acceptance is important. If we can't 
accept then we can’t learn. If we can’t learn, we can't let go.

We are not trying to change the experience. We're trying to change our 
attention  to  the  experience.  Whatever  is  happening  is  happening.  We  are 
 [284]{.pdfpage}  changing  the  way  we're  experiencing  it  in  the  moment.  Instead  of  blindly 
reacting to it, from a place of ignorance, we are pulling our mind into the 
present so that we see things as they are. Letting go happens very naturally. 
Especially  when  the  mind  is  properly  trained. When  we  have  gone  to  the 
efforts  of  training  ourselves,  then  we’ll  find  it  easier  and  easier  when  we 
do get confronted to pull ourselves out of it. We’re not trying to change the 
process.

We’re not complaining about what is happening. Everything is experience. Whatever is happening is happening through cause and effect. If our 
experience is good, we get really happy about it. If our experience is bad, we 
get upset about it. This means we don't see things clearly. We have been a 
reactor reacting to good and bad. A judgement! A judgement formed on the 
back of a feeling. Pleasantness or unpleasantness. It's amazing how all the 
good things in life are associated with pleasantness and all the bad things in 
life are associated with unpleasantness. Why is that? The good is not pleasant. The  pleasant,  if  unseen  properly,  makes  things  good. The  unpleasant,
if not seen properly, makes things bad.
*Good and bad are our reaction to*
*pleasant and unpleasant. That’s all! It's just a judgment in our mind*
. Just 
a  judgment.  It's  not  truth!  There's  no  reality.  Judgment  just  passed  away. 
Where is it gone? It doesn't exist anymore. That's how fleeting the mind is, 
how rapidly it changes.

So  we  have  to  understand  that  nature  is  nature  and  the  objects  are 
objects. And our mind’s reaction is our mind’s reaction. We won't be able 
to undo our old karma, but we can change our reactions to things. We can 
develop  awareness  in  the  present  moment  so  that  we  don't  react  so  negatively to things. And this is what we do in our daily life practice. Just making 
sure that we're not getting triggered. Making sure we're not triggering others. 
Making sure our behavior is acceptable and suitable. If others are being triggered, of course, that's their problem, but we shouldn't contribute knowingly 
to  another  person’s  dukkha.  We  are  trying  to  appreciate  how  the  mind  is 
working. We are just checking our awareness in the present. We’re not trying 
to achieve, to get or to become someone. We are just chilling in the present 
moment watching things arise and pass away without reaction. It's very, very 
peaceful and becomes very blissful once the technique is mastered.

[285]{.pdfpage}  So dhamma is there all the time. It’s everywhere. We just need to take 
the time to have a look at it.
